  <title>The Cube</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We begin our mathematical explorations in a place that may seem unusual.
      The Rubik's Cube, invented<fn>Or, to use Rubik's word, <em>discovered</em>.</fn> in the 1970s by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik, is the best-selling toy of all time.
      It is also a rich mathematical playscape, a tactile means of exploring and challenging our fundamental ideas around what counts as an arithmetic operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cube's colorful, playful nature also underscores our purpose in beginning with it.
      Specifically, exploring the Cube will help us develop some of the virtues Francis Su identifies in
      <xref ref="Su2020" /> under the desire of <em>play</em>: exploring the Cube will hopefuly pique your <em>curiosity</em> and build your <em>patience</em> and <em>perseverance</em>.
      Solving it will require you to <em>change perspectives</em> and build <em>confidence in struggle</em>.
      And, I hope, the satisfaction and joy you experience in finally solving it will engender an <em>openness of spirit</em> that we will carry into further explorations for the rest of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we begin, I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of the <em>
        <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</url>
      </em> project, especially the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/games-and-puzzles"><em>Games and Puzzles</em></url> book.
      I learned the Rubik's Cube by reading and teaching their work, and it is impossible to overstate their influence on this chapter.

      <exploration xml:id="expl_intro">
        <p>
          <statement>
            By yourself or in small groups, consider the questions:
            <ol>
              <li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li>
              <li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>
              <li>What does it mean to be an <em>explorer</em> in your major disciplines?</li>
              <li>What are you excited about this semester? Your answer can be from one of your classes or outside of your classes.</li>
            </ol>
            Write your answers in your notes. We'll discuss your responses before working on

      </exploration>


      <p>
        The Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga identified several elements of play: it should be <em>voluntary</em>; it should be distinct from ordinary life, taking place within its circumscribed time and locality, since dubbed the <q>magic circle</q>; and it, like a game of chess or solve of a Rubik's cube, can be repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the goal of this text to make mathematics playful, inasmuch as is possible.
        We recognize that you may be reading this for a class which was not voluntary, and you are constrained in your mathematical play by the requirements put upon you by your instructor.
        However, we encourage you to approach not only the solution of the Rubik's cube from a playful posture, but subsequent explorations as well.

          <p>
            In your groups, investigate your Cubes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? Make a list of as many observations and questions as you can, and write them in your notes.

        <statement>
          <p>
            The little cubes which make up the Cube are often called <term>cubies</term>. The cubies located at the corners are imaginatively called <term>corner cubies</term>, the cubies located at the centers <term>center cubies</term>, and the others <term>edge cubies</term>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <investigation xml:id="invest-corner-cubies">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In this investigation we'll consider the corner cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.
          <ol>
            <li>How many corners are there?</li>
            <li>How many stickers does a corner cubie have?</li>
            <li>Can you move a corner cubie to a position other than a corner? Explain your reasoning.</li>

          <image xml:id="moving-corner-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
        </statement>
        <solution>
          There are 8 corners, with three stickers each. Since all corners have three stickers, and other cubies have fewer stickers, we can't move a corner cubie to any location other than another corner. But we <em>can</em> move a given corner to any other corner.
        </solution>


      </investigation>

      <investigation xml:id="invest-edge-cubies">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In this investigation we'll consider the edge cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.
          <ol>
            <li>How many edge cubies are there?</li>
            <li>How many stickers does an edge cubie have?</li>
            <li>Can you move an edge cubie to a position other than an edge? Explain your reasoning.</li>
            <li>Identify all the positions on the Cube to which an edge cubie can be moved while keeping the white center cubie on top and red in front.</li>

          <image xml:id="moving-edge-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
        </statement>
        <solution>
          There are twelve edge cubies, with two stickers each. As was the case with corners, we can only put edge cubies in other edge locations, but we can move a given edge cubie to any other edge.
        </solution>

      </investigation>


      <investigation xml:id="invest-center-cubies">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In this investigation we'll consider the center cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.
          <ol>
            <li>How many center cubies are there?</li>
            <li>How many stickers does an center cubie have?</li>

          <image xml:id="moving-center-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
        </statement>
        <solution>
          Finally, we saw that the six center cubies (each with one sticker) cannot move relative to the others.
        </solution>

      </investigation>


      <assemblage>
        <title>Question</title>
        <p>
          <statement>
            How can you tell when a cubie is in the correct <em>location</em>? How can you tell when it is <em>oriented</em> correctly? Is there a difference?<fn>Does it depend on the cubie?</fn>
          </statement>

        </p>
        <solution>
          Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.
        </solution>

      </assemblage>


      <conclusion>
        <p>
          In this section, we thought a bit about play, and began exploring our Cubes.
          There are three types of cubies: corners, edges, and centers.
          We finally noted that since the centers don't move, we can use them to determine if a given cubie is in the right location by checking to see that the stickers on the cubie match the colors of the centers.
        </p>

      <exercise>
        <p>
          Do some research on the internet to determine the number of possible configurations of a Rubik's Cube.
          It's quite large, so think of one or two ways to put this number in context (for instance, a stack of this number of pennies would be how high?).
          Be prepared to share your examples.

    <title>Describing the Cube</title>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Motivating Questions</title>
      <p>
        <statement>
          In this section, we will explore the following questions.
          <ol>
            <li>What are faces and layers, and what methods exist for solving them?</li>
            <li>How can we describe a complex series of Cube moves?</li>
            <li>What is the order of a Cube move?</li>
          </ol>
        </statement>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we'll define a few terms and work on an initial exploration of the Cube's white layer.
        Then, we'll discuss the need for a precise method communicating about our Cubes, and introduce some standard notation.
      </p>
    </introduction>



    <subsection>
      <title>Faces and Layers</title>


      <p>
        We begin with a definition.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-cube-face">
        <index>Cube face</index>
        <index>face</index>
        <index>
          <h>Cube face</h>
          <h>solved</h>
        </index>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>face</term> of the Cube refers to one of its sides.
            We say a face is <term>solved</term> if all the stickers on that side are the same color.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        There are many ways to solve the Cube, and we'll explore one approach later in this chapter.
        A crucial step in learning to solve the Cube is learning to solve one face.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <title>Challenge</title>
        <p>
          <statement>
            Scramble your Cube. Then solve the white face. If you have not done this before (or even if you have), this may take hours or days, not minutes! <emph>Avoid relying on any outside resources</emph> (including websites, friends, etc.).

            When you solve it, congratulations! Then scramble the face and solve it again. Repeat this process until you can reliably do it in just a few minutes. Once you can reliably solve the white face, describe, <emph>in writing</emph>, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can. What challenges did you have to overcome? How did you overcome them?
          </statement>
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        Congratulations on solving a face of your Cube! But a question comes to mind.
        When your white face is in its solved state, are all the cubies on the white face in the correct location?
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-cube-layer">
        <index>Cube layer</index>
        <index>layer</index>
        <index>
          <h>Cube layer</h>
          <h>solved</h>
        </index>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>layer</term> of the Cube consists of a face and all of the stickers on Cubies which compose the face.
            A layer is <term>solved</term> if all of the Cubies in the layer are in the correct location with the correct orientation.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <question>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the difference between a face and a layer?
            How is solving a layer different than solving a face?
          </p>

        <title>Challenge</title>
        <p>
          <statement>
            Scramble your Cube and then solve the white layer. As before, this may take hours or days. When you solve it, congratulations! Scramble it and do it again.

            Once you can reliably solve the white layer, describe, in writing, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can.

            As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail without becoming lost.
            Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing?
            Why or why not?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </principle>

      <p>
        Every area of inquiry has an associated collection of terminology and symbology.
        At its best, this terminology enables efficient and clear communication.
        However, terminology can often be a barrier.
        Thus, we want to avoid introducing unnecessary or confusing jargon whenever possible.
        However, as I hope
        <xref ref="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves" /> and
        <xref ref="discussion-written-cubie-moves" /> underscore, a lack of terminology or symbols severely impairs our ability to communicate deep technical ideas.
        It is with this background that we introduce the following notation, which has become standard in the Cubing community.
      <aside>Indeed, it seems no accident of history that Newton and Leibniz's calculus came about <em>after</em> algebraic notation became standardized.</aside>
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-face-names">

          Hold the Cube in such a way that you are looking at one of the faces (your choice).
        <ul>

          <li>The face on the side opposite the front is referred to as the <term>back</term> (B) face.</li>

      <p>
        As we we will see momentarily, the names described in
        <xref ref="def-face-names" /> not only help us refer to faces, but also moves of the Cube which help us solve it.
        In order to understand what a given move does to the Cube, we will need to refer to certain cubies by location.
        The following definition enables this.

      <p>
        We are most interested in using our new notation to describe <em>moves</em> of the various faces.
        We thus make the following definition.

            A given face name with prime symbol, e.g., <m>R'</m>, denotes a <m>90^\circ</m> counterclockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
            A sequence of face moves is written multiplicatively, left to right.
            We may use parentheses and exponents to write our moves more compactly.

      <title>Order</title>

      <p>
        A useful algebraic concept for describing Cube moves is that of <em>order</em>.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-order">
        <index>
          <h>Cube move</h>
          <h>order</h>
        </index>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The <term>order</term> of a cube move <m>M</m> is the least number of times <m>n \gt 1</m> that <m>M</m> can be repeated before a solved Cube is solved again.
            We write <m>|M| = n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The order of <m>R</m> is 4, since 4 clockwise quarter-turns of the right face of a solved Cube results in a solved Cube, and no fewer number of turns results in a solved Cube.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

    <conclusion>
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>
        In this section, we began a systematic exploration of the properties of the Cube.
        First, we described the need for a notational shorthand in solving the white face and layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard notation refers to each face <em>as you look at it</em>, ignoring color, and describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of the face.
        So, <m>FR</m> means to first turn the front face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise, then the right face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise.
        We then noted that we can refer to a cubie by describing the face(s) on which it sits (using lowercase letters to distinguish cubies from faces): three letters refer to a corner, as it sits at the intersection of three faces; two letters refer to an edge, and one to a center.
      </p>
      <p>
        We concluded by introducing the idea of order, which will help us analyze and understand more complex sequences of Cube moves in the next section.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Our goal in this chapter is to explore, and eventually solve, the Cube.
        To do this, every cubie must be in the correct <em>location</em> with the correct <em>orientation</em>.
        In this section, we focus on two moves which will allow us to put the cubies in the correct location.
        Once they are in the correct location, we'll see moves in the next section which will help us orient them correctly, enabling us to (finally) solve the Cube.

        We first found

        Similarly,
        <xref ref="cube-move-er" /> affects edges on the up face, and no other cubies.
        We were then able to put every cubie on our Cube in the correct location. Hurray!

    <title>Reorienting Cubies</title>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Motivating Questions</title>
      <p>
        <statement>
          In this section, we will explore the following questions.
          <ol>
            <li>How can we change the orientation of the corner cubies?</li>
            <li>How can we change the orientation of the edge cubies?</li>
            <li>How can we apply our four Cube moves to solve the Cube?</li>
          </ol>
        </statement>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In
        <xref ref="sec-play-moving-cubies" />, we considered ways of moving certain edge and corner cubies.
        The key that allows us to use
        <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and
        <xref ref="cube-move-er" /> to put your cubies in the correct location is that each move affects precisely three cubies.
        All others are left unmoved.
        By using just
        <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and
        <xref ref="cube-move-er" />, we can thus put each cubie in the correct location.
        However, even if a cubie is in the correct location, it may be that its stickers are on the wrong faces
        <mdash />in this case, it needs to be <em>reoriented</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this section, we will see how to reorient cubies once they are in the correct location.
        To do so, we'll learn two moves: one that reorients corners, and one that reorients edges.
        Once we are able to put each cubie in the correct location, and then orient it correctly, each scrambled Cube becomes a puzzle, solvable by clever application of these moves.
      </p>

    <conclusion>
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>
        In this section, we explored the last moves we need to solve the Cube.
        We also described a strategy for solving the Cube.
        Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn.
        The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are advantages and disadvantages to all solution methods.
        Advantages to corners-first are:
      <ul>
        <li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
        <li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
        <li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
        <li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
