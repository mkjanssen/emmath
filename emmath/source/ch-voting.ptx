          In this section, we will explore the following questions.
          <ol>
            <li>What is a voting system?</li>
            <li>What are some common means of choosing winners of elections?</li>
            <li>What are some drawbacks for these common systems?</li>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Our main task in this chapter is to explore the mathematics of voting systems.
        A <term>voting system</term> refers both to the ways votes are cast in elections <em>and</em> the way those votes are used to determine a winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will see in this section that while two-candidate systems are fairly straightforward, they provide a fertile ground for exploring the characteristics we desire in all systems.
        We first want to determine how each system treats the voters and the candidates.
        A fair system should aim to treat each voter and each candidate equally.
      </p>
    </introduction>


    <activity xml:id="act-voting-intro">
      <statement>
        <p>
          It is time for the citizens of Scranton to elect a new mayor, and they have two choices: Angela and Stanley.
          How could the winner of this election be determined?
          How <em>should</em> the winner of this election be determined?

    <investigation xml:id="invest-dictatorship">
      <index>dictatorship</index>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If
          <xref ref="act-voting-intro" /> seemed too easy, consider the following (likely alternative) suggestion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angela's husband, Dwight, has been a longtime player in Scranton politics.
          Thus, the system Scranton has adopted is: everyone votes, but whomever Dwight votes for will be declared the winner, regardless of how the other votes are cast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the 76,328 citizens of Scranton, suppose 76,327 vote for Stanley, and Dwight votes for Angela. Who wins the election?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Angela wins!
        </p>

      </solution>
    </investigation>

    <p>
      The method described in
      <xref ref="invest-dictatorship" /> is known as a <term>dictatorship</term>, with Dwight as the dictator.
      We note that, in the context of voting theory, the word <em>dictatorship</em> only refers to how the outcomes of elections are determined and has nothing to do with the system of government.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does a dictatorship treat all voters equally? That is, does every vote count <q>the same</q>? Does a dictatorship treat the candidates equally? Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          It does not. George's special status means the system treats him differently than the other voters.
        </p>

      </solution>
    </exploration>




    <investigation xml:id="invest-imposedrule">
      <index>imposed rule</index>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a dictatorship isn't your style, try this one: before the election runs and the citizens of Scranton vote, it is decided that Angela will win.
          Does this method treat all of the voters equally? That is, do all votes count the same? Does it treat the candidates equally? That is, could each candidate win, depending on the how the votes come in? Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes, all voters are treated equally. Each voter has the same amount of influence on the outcome.
          On the other hand, the candidates are not treated equally. One candidate is chosen ahead of time, and the other one has no chance, regardless how the votes come in.
        </p>

      </solution>
    </investigation>

    <p>
      The method described in
      <xref ref="invest-imposedrule" /> is known as <term>imposed rule</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's try one more system on for size.
    </p>

    <investigation xml:id="invest-minorityrule">
      <index>minority rule</index>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the following system. Each citizen of Scranton votes, and the votes are counted. The winner is the candidate with the <em>smallest</em> number of votes.
          This is known as <term>minority rule</term>.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Suppose that the citizens of Scranton vote, with 76,327 voters voting for Stanley and one (Dwight, no longer a dictator) votes for Angela. Who wins under minority rule?</li>
          <li>Now suppose that Dwight convinces 38164 of the prospective Stanley voters to switch and vote for Angela. Who wins in this case under minority rule?</li>
          <li>Does minority rule treat all voters equally? Does it treat all candidates equally? Explain.</li>
          <li>Under minority rule, is it beneficial or detrimental for a candidate to receive additional votes? Explain.</li>
        </ol>
      </statement>


    </investigation>


    <p>
      <index>fairness criteria</index>
      In our quest for a mathematically just voting system, we will find it helpful to define certain desirable qualities for a fair and just system to satisfy.
      <em>However</em>: When we say that a voting system satisfies a certain criterion, we mean that it <em>always</em> satisfies it; that is, it can never violate that criterion.
      We will refer to these important criteria as <term>fairness criteria</term>. We have already observed a few important criteria that we now formally define.

      <index>
        <h>fairness criteria</h>
        <h>monotone</h>
      </index>
      <p>
        A voting system for a two-candidate election is <term>anonymous</term> if it treats all voters equally. That is, if any two voters switched their votes, the outcome of the election should remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        A voting system for a two-candidate election is <term>neutral</term> if it treats both candidates equally.
        That is, if <em>every</em> voter changes their vote, the outcome of the election should also change.
      </p>
      <p>
        A voting system for a two-candidate election is <term>monotone</term> if is impossible for a winning candidate to become a losing candidate by gaining votes (and not losing any others), or for a losing candidate to become a winning candidate by losing votes (and not gaining any others).

          Now suppose three members of the board of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company are voting to determine who should take over the business.
          The candidates are Michael and Andy.
          In order to vote, their <q>friend</q>, Toby, has devised a voting system.

    <p>
      The two-candidate voting system we haven't yet explored is probably the one that you actually suggested in
      <xref ref="act-voting-intro" />.
      Perhaps it is something like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Each voter should vote for the candidate they want to win the election.
      Whichever candidate gets the most votes wins the election.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is known as <term>majority rule</term>.
    </p>


    <investigation>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the three fairness criteria does majority rule satisfy? Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          All of them! It behaves much the same way as minority rule, except now it's helpful to get more votes.
        </p>

      </solution>

    </investigation>

    <p>
      In fact, for elections with two candidates, majority rule is the only system to satisfy all three fairness criteria.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-may">
      <creator>K. May (1952)</creator>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In a two-candidate election with an odd number of voters, majority rule is the only voting system that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone and avoids the possibility of a tie.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <conclusion>
      <p>
        Thus, for elections with two candidates, there is a clear fair and just choice for a voting system subject: majority rule.
        However, as we know, most elections don't have just two candidates, so in the remainder of this chapter we will consider the question of fairness in the context of these larger elections.
        We'll refine the existing fairness criteria to handle three or more candidates, and develop additional criteria due to surprising situations that can arise.

          In fact, many political scientists believe that Ralph Nader was a <em>spoiler candidate</em> for Gore in 2000; that is, they believe that a large percentage of the Nader voters likely would have voted for Gore if Nader had not been on the ballot.
          In this section, we'll explore the wrinkles introduced by additional candidates, and develop alternative systems for choosing winners of elections.
          First, we'll define an important term for a concept you are likely already familiar with.
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-plurality">
          <index>plurality</index>
          <p>
            A candidate in an election who receives more votes than any of the other candidates is said to receive a <term>plurality</term> of the votes cast.
          </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
          It is crucial that we understand the difference between <em>plurality</em> and <em>majority</em>.
        </p>

        <principle>
          <statement>
            <ol>
              <li>For elections with two candidates, explain why the words <em>plurality</em> and <em>majority</em> mean exactly the same thing.</li>
              <li>For elections with more than two candidates, explain why the words <em>plurality</em> and <em>majority</em> do not mean exactly the same thing.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <term>Majority rule</term> is the voting system that elects the candidate who receives more than half the votes, if such a candidate exists. If no such candidate exists, the election is declared a tie with no winner.
              </li>
              <li>The <term>plurality method</term> is the voting system that elects the candidate that receives the largest number of votes. The plurality method only produces a tie when two candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, and this number is more than any other candidate.</li>

          </statement>
        </definition>

          We now explore the plurality method in more depth.
          Because it is familiar, it likely seems quite fair.

        <title>A solution</title>

        <p>
          As we saw in
          <xref ref="expl-office-voting" />, when there are <m>N</m> candidates, it is possible for the vote to be split so thoroughly that one candidate can win with just over <m>1/N</m>-th of the vote.
          In this case, a majority of the voters will prefer someone other than the person who is ultimately elected.
          But as we saw, the situation can get even worse than that
          <mdash />it's possible for the candidate who wins the plurality of the vote to be the <em>last</em> choice of a <em>majority</em> of voters, but still win!
          The main reason that the plurality method is susceptible to this is that it only accounts for a voter's first choice; there is no penalty for being a voter's last choice, and no benefit to being the voter's second choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          <index>preference order</index>
          We will therefore explore methods of voting and fairness criteria that account for a full top-to-bottom ranking of candidates by voters, called a <term>preference order</term>.
          If there are three candidates in an election, say Michael, Angela, and Stanley, and my preference order is that Michael is my top candidate, Stanley my second choice, and Angela my third, we may write <m>M \succ S \succ A</m>, where the symbol <m>\succ</m> means "is preferred to".
        </p>

        <activity>
          <statement>
            <ol>
              <li>Consider a 3-candidate election for the mayorship of Scranton between Michael, Angela, and Stanley. How many possible preference orders are there? In other words, in how many different ways could the voters rank them?</li>
              <li>Suppose their friend Toby enters the race, bringing the total number of candidates to 4. Now how many preference orders are possible now?</li>
            </ol>
          </statement>
        </activity>

        <p>
          <index>preference ballot</index>
          Since our voters will be casting <term>preference ballots</term>, we need a different way of displaying the votes cast.
        </p>

        <exploration xml:id="expl-dmprez">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose Stanley, Toby, Angela, and Michael are running for the presidency of Dunder Mifflin, the premier paper company in Scranton.
              The preference orders for each of the 13 board members of the company are displayed in
              <xref ref="table-dmprez" />, a visualization known as a <term>preference schedule</term>.
              The column headings indicate the number of voters with the preference order displayed in the column. For instance, the first column shows that 6 shareholders have the preference order <m>S \succ A \succ T \succ M</m>.
              Note that the preference orders displayed are the five that were cast as preference ballots in the election; there are many others that were possible but not cast, and thus are not displayed.

        <title>The Borda Count</title>

        <p>
          One very popular method for choosing the winner of a multi-candidate election is the Borda count.
        </p>

        <definition>
          <index>Borda count</index>
          <index>
            <h>voting system</h>
            <h>Borda count</h>
          </index>
          <p>
            Consider an election with <m>N</m> candidates.
            The <term>Borda count</term> works as follows.
            Each voter submits a ballot that contains their entire preference order for all candidates in the election.
            For each ballot cast, points are awarded to each candidate according to the following rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A last-place vote is worth 1 point.</li>
            <li>A second-to-last-place vote is worth 2 points.</li>
            <li>
              <m>\vdots</m>
            </li>
            <li>A third-place vote is worth <m>N-2</m> points.</li>
            <li>A second-place vote is worth <m>N-1</m> points.</li>
            <li>A first-place vote is worth <m>N</m> points.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The candidate who accumulates the largest number of total points from all of the ballots is declared the winner, and the societal preference order is determined by listing the candidates in order of the number of points they received, largest to smallest.
            If two or more candidates are tied with the largest number of points, they are all declared winners (or some suitable prearranged tiebreaking procedure is used).
          </p>

          Lest you think this is a contrived example, be aware that things like this can happen in real life.
          A version of the Borda count is used by the Associated Press to rank the top 25 college football and basketball teams.
          In the 1971 AP preseason poll, the author's Nebraska Cornhuskers received 26 of 50 first-place votes, yet were ranked #2.
          The results of things like this AP polling anomaly or
          <xref ref="act-dmprez2" /> suggest a new fairness criterion.

        <conclusion>
          <p>
            In this section, we have seen that things become more complicated when we consider more than two candidates.
            In an election with only two candidates, a vote for one implicitly ranks the other candidate second.
            With more than two candidates, not only can societal preferences be more diffuse, but they are also more complex than can be captured with simple plurality voting.
            It is possible for a candidate who is the least desirable choice of an <em>overwhelming majority</em> of the voters to win if there are enough other candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next section, we will explore additional voting systems and fairness criteria that attempt to overcome the shortcomings of the Borda count.

            Read about the 2016 Republican presidential primary process.
            How many candidates were there? How many (total) votes were cast? Assuming the only thing that mattered was the total number of first-place votes received, how few votes could a candidate have (hypothetically) received and still been declared the winner?

          In

          Perhaps worse, we also saw that plurality <em>can</em> elect a candidate who would <em>lose</em> a head-to-head matchup against all other candidates.
          This has struck voting theorists as unfair, and we make the following definition, named after Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, the Marquis de Condorcet.

        <p>
          The phenomenon observed in
          <xref ref="invest-iia" /> is an example of a violation of a new fairness criterion, the <em>independence of irrelevant alternatives</em>.
          It's more subtle than some of the others, so we'll present a few versions of it.
        </p>

        <definition>
          <p>
            If a voting system has the property that the societal preference between any two candidates depends only on the voters' preferences between those two candidates, then the system is said to satisfy the <term>independence of irrelevant alternatives</term> criterion (IIA).
          </p>
          <p>
            Put another way, a voting system satisfies IIA if some or all of the voters in an election change their preference ballots but no voter changes their preference between two candidates <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then the societal preference between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must also remain unchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, if an election is run and produces <m>X</m> as the winner, and later a non-winning candidate <m>Y</m> drops out, then <m>X</m> should still be the winner of the election.
          </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
          IIA is often interpreted as saying that if a candidate (<m>A</m>) would win an election, and a new candidate (<m>B</m>) were added to the ballot, then either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> should win the election.
          A further delightful illustration of a violation of IIA is attributed to <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser">Sidney Morgenbesser</url>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says <q>In that case I'll have the blueberry pie.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Let's consider our current systems and IIA.

          <statement>
            <ol>
              <li> Does plurality satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>

          We thus see that when there is no Condorcet winner, the agenda can play an outsize role in the outcome of an election decided by sequential pairwise voting.
          Since the order in which the candidates are presented seems to matter, it's reasonable to guess that SPV violates the neutrality criterion, which we confirm in the next exploration.

        <title>Instant Runoff Voting and Arrow's Theorem</title>




        <p>
          In this section, we'll examine one last (new) voting system, called <term>instant runoff voting</term> (IRV) or <term>ranked choice voting</term> (RCV).
        <aside>The nonpartisan election advocacy group, FairVote, refers to this system as RCV. I prefer calling the system <em>instant runoff</em>; the non-plurality systems we've looked at for three or more candidates all involve ranking candidates, so I find the term too general.</aside>
        This system was proposed in the mid-1800s by Thomas Hare, and has slowly grown in popularity.
        Other than plurality, it is likely the most widely used system for choosing elected officials in the U.S.
        For example, the <url href="http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/index.htm">City of Minneapolis</url> uses IRV for its city-wide elections, and <url href="http://www.rcvmaine.com">Maine uses it for all state-wide elections</url>, including, for the first time in 2020, for the <url href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maine-ranked-choice-voting-2020_n_5d72ca74e4b06451356df0f3">general election for president</url>.
        </p>

        <definition>
          <p>
            The instant runoff voting (IRV) system works as follows.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Each voter in the election submits their entire preference order.</li>
            <li>If a candidate has a majority of first-place votes, they are declared the winner.</li>
            <li>If no candidate has a majority of first-place votes, then the candidate (or candidates, in the case of a tie) with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated from each voter's preference order, and the remaining candidates are moved up, yielding a new preference schedule.</li>
            <li>Step 2 is repeated until a single candidate remains. That candidate is declared the winner.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>
          At this point, you may be wondering which voting system is best. We saw a decisive answer if our election has only two candidates (the familiar <em>majority rule</em>), but when the election has more than two candidates, things have gotten complicated. Plurality, majority rule, the Borda count, PWC, and IRV all fail to satisfy at least one of our criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1951, economist <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</url> proved the following landmark result. It states that our quest is hopeless! There is no fairest voting system.
          Each has tradeoffs which make it suitable in certain circumstances and unsuitable in others.
        </p>


        <assemblage>
          <title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>

          <p>
            In an election with more than two candidates, it is impossible for a voting system to satisfy monotonicity, neutrality, anonymity, IIA, the majority criterion, and the CWC.
          <aside>Technically, we also need to assume that the votes matter (not imposed rule), and that there is no dictator.</aside>
          </p>
        </assemblage>

        <!-- <principle>
              <p>
                There is an ongoing debate about whether voting systems other than plurality are truly <q>democratic</q>.
                For instance, lawmakers in Maine have repeatedly attempted to overturn the implementation of IRV for statewide elections, despite it passing on a statewide ballot initiative.

              What do you think? Regardless of which system you choose, what do you think of systems that take voter preferences beyond their first choice into account?
              What effect(s) do you think they might have on elections? On campaigning?
              Are there any other advantages or disadvantages you'd like to raise?
            </p>
          </principle> -->


        <conclusion>
          <p>
            In this section, we explored additional voting systems (the method of pairwise comparisions and instant runoff voting) and fairness criteria (IIA and the monotonicity criterion).
            As we saw that none of our systems satisfied all of our criteria, we were faced with a question: is there <em>any</em> voting system out there that is completely fair?
            Arrow's landmark theorem tells us that no democratic voting system can satisfy all of our criteria.
            This does not mean that our explorations have been fruitless
            <mdash />instead, we'll need to consider which criteria are most important to us when selecting a voting system, and choose accordingly.
