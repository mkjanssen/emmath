<p>A recursive definition is nice because it is reasonably intuitive and fits with our usual understanding of how things change over time: they start from where they are now, and then change a little every so often. But perhaps we'd like to know how long it will take Joris to accumulate 500 games. </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Clearly describe in 2-3 sentences <em class="emphasis">a process</em> for using the recursive definition in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-recursive.html" title="Example 4.1.2">ExampleÂ 4.1.2</a> that would allow you to determine how many years it would take Joris to accumulate 500 board games. Please do not use this process to answer the question!</p></li>
<li><p>In 2-3 sentences, describe the disadvantage in the process you used in Question 1 for finding how long it would take Joris to accumulate 500 games.</p></li>
<li><p>What we want is a <dfn class="terminology">explicit formula</dfn> for <span class="process-math">\(G_t\text{.}\)</span> That is, we want a formula that allows us to plug in a value for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> that will give us the number of games <span class="process-math">\(G_t\)</span> that Joris has in year <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> without having to know any of the previous terms in the sequence. Find such a formula, and compute the first three terms to convince your group that your formula produces the same sequence as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-recursive-games.html" title="Equation 4.1.1">(4.1.1)</a>.</p></li>
