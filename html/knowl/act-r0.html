<span class="type">Activity</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.2.13</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p>In this activity, we assume different values for <span class="process-math">\(r_0\text{.}\)</span> However, we will make two assumptions that don't change.</p>
<p>First, assume that all direct infections are done within a 5-day period. Second, assume that that those infected don't infect others until the next five day period.</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(C_t\)</span> be the number of cases I've caused after <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> five-day periods. Assume <span class="process-math">\(C_0 = 1\)</span> (me).</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Explain why <span class="process-math">\(C_1 = r_0 C_0 = r_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Explain why <span class="process-math">\(C_2 = C_1 + r_0 C_1 = r_0 + r_0^2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>After 30 days, six five-day periods will have passed. Explain why<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C_6 = r_0 + r_0^2 + r_0^3 + \cdots + r_0^6.
\end{equation*}
</div></p></li>
<li><p>Our SIR model approximates <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span> by the formula<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/act-sirnumbers.html">
\begin{equation}
r_0 \approx \frac{bN}{a}.\tag{4.2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>Using that formula, what is the approximate <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span> for the situation described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-sirnumbers.html" title="Activity 4.2.11">Activity 4.2.11</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Given that value of <span class="process-math">\(r_0\text{,}\)</span> use the Sage cell below (replacing the ? with the value you found) to estimate how many cases Sam directly or indirectly causes over a 30-day period.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing" target="_blank">social distancing</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-36-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> is intended to reduce <span class="process-math">\(r_0\text{.}\)</span> Assume that strict social distancing is observed, and this reduces <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span> to approximately 1.25 (one direct infection fewer). Now how many cases does Sam cause over the course of a 30-day period?</p></li>
<li><p>As the COVID-19 situation is ongoing, estimates for <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span> vary significantly (and are variant-dependent). <a class="external" href="https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/2/taaa021/5735319" target="_blank">One study from February 2020</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-37-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> found an average <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span> of 3.28. If that is the true number, approximately how many cases will a typical infected person be responsible for over the course of a month? Use the Sage cell to determine your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Other studies suggest that, in the absence of any social interventions, the original variant of COVID-19 has <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \approx 2.38\text{.}\)</span> In that case, how many cases would an infected person be responsible for over the course of a month?</p></li>
<li><p>The Delta variant of COVID-19 has <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \approx 5.1\text{.}\)</span> If I am infected with the Delta variant, approximately how many new cases will I cause within a month?</p></li>
<li><p>The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has an estimated <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \approx 10\)</span> (note that this is being written in February 2022, just as the first major Omicron wave is subsiding; it should therefore be treated as preliminary). If Sam is infected with the Omicron variant, approximately how many new cases will he cause within a month?</p></li>
