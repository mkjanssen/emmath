<p>Suppose your friendly local university is looking to schedule its final exams. Obviously, it can't schedule them so that someone in two different classes is scheduled for an exam at the same time. But how many times are actually required?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>First, make up a list of at least 5 courses, and 10 students who are in some of these courses. Ensure that each course shares at least one student in common with at least two other courses (this is just to make the problem sufficiently interesting).</p></li>
<li><p>Create a graph whose vertices are the courses. Draw an edge between any pair of courses for which a student is enrolled in both courses.</p></li>
<li><p>How many colors are required to color the vertices so that no pair of adjacent vertices gets the same color? <em class="emphasis">Can</em> the answer be more than 4? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p>How many final exam timeslots are required?</p></li>
