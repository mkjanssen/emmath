<p>Scramble your Cube. Then solve the white face. If you have not done this before (or even if you have), this may take hours or days, not minutes! Avoid relying on any outside resources (including websites, friends, etc.). When you solve it, congratulations! Then scramble the face and solve it again. Repeat this process until you can reliably do it in just a few minutes. Once you can reliably solve the white face, describe, in writing, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can. What challenges did you have to overcome? How did you overcome them?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-play-describing-the-cube.html#assemblage-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
