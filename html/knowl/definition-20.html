<p>Consider a population of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> people through which a disease is spreading. For some discrete time <span class="process-math">\(t \ge 0\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(S_t\)</span> denote the number of individuals <em class="emphasis">susceptible</em> to the disease, <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span> the number of individuals <em class="emphasis">infected</em> with the disease, and <span class="process-math">\(R_t\)</span> the number of individuals who have <em class="emphasis">recovered</em> from the disease. We assume that that people move through the compartments as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
S \to I \to R.\tag{4.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>For <span class="process-math">\(t\ge 1\text{,}\)</span> the model is given by the following equations.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
N \amp = S_t + I_t + R_t\\
S_{t+1} \amp = S_t -b S_t I_t\\
I_{t+1} \amp = I_t + b S_t I_t - a I_t\\
R_{t+1} \amp = R_t + a I_t.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The constant <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is known as the <em class="emphasis">recovery rate</em> parameter, which roughly describes how fast someone moves from the infected compartment to the recovered compartment. The constant <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is known as the <em class="emphasis">infection rate</em>, and roughly describes how fast someone moves from the susceptible compartment to the infected compartment.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dds.html#definition-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
