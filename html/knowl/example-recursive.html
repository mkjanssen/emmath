<p>Joris is a collector of board games. His collection currently has 37 games, and each year he budgets enough to acquire 8 new games. We'll use the notation <span class="process-math">\(G_t\)</span> to describe how many games Joris has in year <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> where we consider <span class="process-math">\(G_0\)</span> (that is, in year <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span>) to be the number of games he currently has. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(G_0 = 37\text{.}\)</span> We would also expect <span class="process-math">\(G_1 = 37 + 8 = 45\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G_2 = 45 + 8 = 53\text{.}\)</span> We say that <span class="process-math">\(37, 45, 53\ldots\)</span> are the first three <dfn class="terminology">terms</dfn> of the sequence.</p>
<p>This way of describing the number of games Joris has is known as a <dfn class="terminology">recursive</dfn> description, where each term depends on previous terms. That is, the recursive description is given by the formula</p>
