<p>Twenty-one people filed paperwork with the U.S. Federal Election Commission as candidates for the 2016 Republication nomination for president. There were 31,183,841 votes cast in the Republican primaries nationwide in 2016.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Donald Trump received 14,015,993 of these votes. Did he receive a majority of the votes cast in the Republican primaries?</p></li>
<li><p>If the winner of the 2016 Republican nomination had been chosen by plurality from these 21 candidates, what is the smallest number of votes Trump could have received and still had a chance at winning the nomination? (Assume that the number of votes remains fixed at 31,183,841.)</p></li>
<li><p>Under the same assumptions as Question 2, what is the maximum number of voters who could have preferred Trump the <em class="emphasis">least</em> among the 21 candidates in order for him to still have had a chance of winning the nomination?</p></li>
<li><p>Using your answers to Questions 2 and 3, formulate a well-written criticism of the plurality method. You don't have to agree with your argument, but put yourself in the shoes of a critic and try to predict the type of argument that could be made.</p></li>
