</h5>
<p>With a House size of 299 seats, Alabama's standard quota was 7.646, Illinois' was 18.640, and Texas's was 9.640. Ranked from largest to smallest by decimal part, Alabama was 20th on the list. With 299 seats, there were 20 surplus seats to dole out.</p>
<p>With 300 seats, the standard quotas for all states increased a bit. (Why?) Alabama's increased to 7.671, Illinois' to 18.702, and Texas' to 9.672. This moved Illinois into the 20th spot in line, with Texas next, and then Alabama. With a House of size 300, there were 21 surplus seats to be doled out, rather than 20.</p>
