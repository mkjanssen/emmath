<p>It's time to vote for the mayor of Scranton again, and this time there are thirteen candidates: Jim, Pam, Michael, Dwight, Andy, Angela, Kevin, Stanley, Phyllis, Ryan, Kelly, Meredith, and Toby.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Suppose Kevin wins with 6,000 votes out of 76,328 cast. Did he receive a majority of the votes cast for mayor? (You may want to convince yourself that this is possible!) What percentage of the overall vote did he receive?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <em class="emphasis">smallest</em> number of votes Kevin could have received and still won the election? (Be careful!)</p></li>
<li><p>Under the scenario described in the previous question, what is the <em class="emphasis">largest</em> number of voters who could have preferred Kevin <em class="emphasis">least</em> among all 13 candidates and still left him with a chance at winning the election?</p></li>
<li><p>Using your answers to the previous question, carefuly articulate a critique of the plurality method.</p></li>
