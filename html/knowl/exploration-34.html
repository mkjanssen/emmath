</h5>
<p>For the 1902 apportionment, the Census Bureau gave Congress a table showing the apportionments under Hamilton's method for all House sizes from 350 to 400.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>When the number of seats in the House was 350-382, 386, 389, and 390, Maine would be given three seats, but for all other sizes Maine would be given four.</p></li>
<li><p>When the number of House seats was 357, Colorado would be given two seats, but for all other House sizes Colorado would be given three seats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based only on these data, would the Alabama paradox have occurred for at least one House size between 350 and 400 seats (under Hamilton's method)? If so, for which House sizes and which states?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-apportionment-paradoxes.html#exploration-34" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
