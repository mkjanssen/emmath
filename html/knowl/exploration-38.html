<p>In 1907, Oklahoma was the 46th state to join the Union. Rather than completely reapportion the seats, Congress decided to give Oklahoma 5 seats, as this was in proportion to its share of the country's population. This increased the House size from 386 to 391. However, the following hypothetical apportionments were noted under Hamilton's method:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>With 45 states (pre-Oklahoma) and 386 seats, New York would have been awarded 38 seats and Maine 4 seats.</p></li>
<li><p>With 46 seats (including Oklahoma) and 391 seats, New York would have been awarded 37 seats and Maine 5 seats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Explain why this is yet another paradox (called the <dfn class="terminology">new-states paradox</dfn>).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-apportionment-paradoxes.html#exploration-38" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
