<p>The most famous set of axioms are Euclid's postulates for geometry, defined in <em class="emphasis"><a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements" target="_blank">The Elements</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-18" id="fn-18"><sup> 1 </sup></a></em>, which not only shaped thousands of years of geometry, but solidified the deductive approach to doing and explaining mathematics that we will explore in this unit. At the beginning of Book I of <em class="emphasis">The Elements</em>, Euclid identified five postulates and five axioms.</p>
<p>Euclid's <em class="emphasis">postulates</em> are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</p></li>
<li><p>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>Any circle can be described given a center and (radial) distance.</p></li>
<li><p>All right angles are equal to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>If a straight line intersecting two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Euclid's <em class="emphasis">axioms</em> (or <em class="emphasis">common notions</em>) are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</p></li>
<li><p>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</p></li>
<li><p>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole is greater than the part.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The desired qualities of a system of axioms are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">consistency</dfn>: we cannot deduce contradictory propositions, such as "God exists" and "God does not exist" from the same set of axioms</p></li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">simplicity</dfn>: we have as few axioms as possible, and they are no more complicated than they need to be</p></li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">completeness</dfn>: the system can answer every question we can think to ask</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In your groups, discuss Euclid's postulates and common notions, perhaps in view of the desired qualities of an axiomatic system. What strikes you as being interesting or noteworthy? Make a list of at least 2-3 observations. Then consider: on what axioms or assumptions do you make decisions (e.g., about how to spend your time, resources, etc)?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-6.html#investigation-5" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
