<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The question in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/disc-ch.html" title="Discussion 3.2.4">DiscussionÂ 3.2.4</a> leads to just such a proposition, namely that no such set \(S\) exists. This has been known as the <dfn class="terminology">continuum hypothesis</dfn>. It was first suggested by Cantor in 1878, and was one of Hilbert's 23 problems. Godel himself proved in 1940 that its negation, i.e., that such a set \(S\) does exist, is independent of the usual axioms of set theory. The mathematician Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that the continuum hypothesis itself is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, thus verifying that the hypothesis is undecidable.</p>
