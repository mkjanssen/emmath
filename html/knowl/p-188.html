<p>The idea that we can compare sizes of collections of objects by placing them in one-to-one correspondence is known to very young children. However, they are mostly concerned with finite collections. Georg Cantor's crucial insight in studying the mathematics of the infinite was that one-to-one correspondences could also be used to study infinite collections of numbers. This is widely (though not universally) accepted today, but was the subject of much controversy in the late 19th century when he introduced it.</p>
