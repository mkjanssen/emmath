<p>In this section, we explored the idea of a (discrete) sequence. A sequence is just a list of numbers, and we considered sequences which are (in theory, at least) infinite. We saw two ways of describing a sequence other than just listing the numbers in order: recursively, and with an explicit formula. The recursive definition fits with our intuition about how quantities change over time, but it can be tedious to calculate terms that appear late in the sequence, as you need to calculate every term leading up to the one in which you're interested. Explicit formulas, on the other hand, give us shortcuts to calculating any term we want, but can often be hard to find and can obscure the actual behavior of the sequence.</p>
