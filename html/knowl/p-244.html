<p>We now arrive at the main goal of this chapter: the description of a basic mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease. We'll first present the model itself and examine its features and assumptions. As was the case with the predator-prey model, we'll see that while it does make simplifying assumptions, it still allows us to analyze the broader dynamics of the disease transmission. We'll then look at ways of reducing the rate of infection, including the so-called "flattening the curve" method.</p>
