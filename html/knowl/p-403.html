<p>In 1850, Samuel Vinton proposed what turned out to be Hamilton's method all over again, though no one remembered it as such<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> It happens that Hamilton's method cannot violate quota (why?). It was used for the apportionments of 1852 and 1862, though by 1872, Congress illegally and unconstitutionally apportioned seats based on no method at all. This had consequences for the presidential election of 1876, where Hayes defeated Tilden based on the electoral college, whereas if Hamilton's method had been used in 1872, Tilden would have easily won.</p>
