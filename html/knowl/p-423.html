<p>As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/expl-office-voting.html" title="Exploration 7.2.7">Exploration 7.2.7</a>, when there are <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> candidates, it is possible for the vote to be split so thoroughly that one candidate can win with just over <span class="process-math">\(1/N\)</span>-th of the vote. In this case, a majority of the voters will prefer someone other than the person who is ultimately elected. But as we saw, the situation can get even worse than that—it's possible for the candidate who wins the plurality of the vote to be the <em class="emphasis">last</em> choice of a <em class="emphasis">majority</em> of voters, but still win! The main reason that the plurality method is susceptible to this is that it only accounts for a voter's first choice; there is no penalty for being a voter's last choice, and no benefit to being the voter's second choice.</p>
