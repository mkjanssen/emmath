<p>This text is sufficient for a one-semester “liberal arts” math course. My stated goal with the text is to expand its readers' notion of the sorts of questions that mathematics can help answer. In addition to those found here, one could choose many different topics for such a course, and I hope to add more over the coming years. I would also welcome suggestions and contributions from the text's users, so feel free to get in touch if you'd like to explore these ideas further. Additionally, the independent nature of the topics in such a course means that the order in which things are covered matters little; I typically cover them in more or less the order presented here.</p>
