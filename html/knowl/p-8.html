<p>The text is designed with a focus on active learning. I've found that it works particularly well as a sequenced collection of small-group activities. Also, as the <a href="Sec-Introduction.html" class="internal" title="Preface: Introduction">PrefaceÂ </a> suggests, I've designed and grouped these topics and activities so that they can be read with Francis Su and Christopher Jackson's <em class="emphasis">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</em>. I typically have students read and discuss Chapters 1-5 as we are transitioning from Play to Truth, Chapters 6-7 as we transition from Truth to Power, Chapters 8-11 as we shift from Power to Justice, and Chapters 12-13 (and the epilogue) near the end of the course. I am consistently impressed by their insights and the connections they make between their own major disciplines and mathematics as described by Su and Jackson.</p>
