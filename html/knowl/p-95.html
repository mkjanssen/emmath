<p>Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth. One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. Yet, mathematics is a human endeavor; and what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being “true”, anyway? The answer might surprise you.</p>
