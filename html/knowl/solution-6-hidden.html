<p>Axioms are unproved, self-evident propositions on top of which logical deductions can be made, and entire fields of study rest. They should be as simple as possible; all except Euclid's fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) are considered quite straightforward. The parallel postulate has a fascinating history; it turns out be independent of the other postulates, and one can create new geometries (on the surface of a sphere, for instance), by rejecting it.</p>
<p>There are lots of unproved assumptions that we make in life. Many Christian mathematicians make explicit that they view the authority of Scripture as an axiom; they can't use logic to conclusively deduce that Scripture is the only authority for Christian faith and life, but they <em class="emphasis">assume</em> it in order to draw conclusions <em class="emphasis">about</em> faith and life.</p>
