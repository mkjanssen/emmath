<p>Alice wants to send a bit of information to her friend Bob; for simplicity's sake, let's assume she seeks to send a 0 or 1. To ensure that the digit is received correctly, she decides to send it three times in a row. Bob will then read the intended digit as the digit that appears most often.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>How would Bob interpret Alice's message if he received <span class="process-math">\(111\text{?}\)</span> What if he received <span class="process-math">\(010\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>What strengths and weaknesses do you see in Alice's system? How could you improve upon it?</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps you decided that Alice's system isn't sure enough, so you decide she should send the digit seven times. In what way(s) is this revised system better? Worse?</p></li>
