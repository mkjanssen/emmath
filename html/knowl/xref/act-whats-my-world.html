<div class="para">In the game <em class="emphasis">What’s my World?</em>, one person thinks of a single law that defines a hypothetical world (e.g., “My world does not contain things that start with the letter “C”.”). The other players attempt to guess this governing law by taking turns asking questions of the creator, such as “Does your world contain dogs? Does it contain cats?” and so on. When one of the guessers believe they can identify the governing law, they ask the creator.</div> <div class="para">Play a few rounds of this game, taking turns in the role of creator. <em class="emphasis">Other than asking the creator directly</em>, how could you be <em class="emphasis">certain</em> that you had determined the law of the world?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="chap-reasoning-3.html#act-whats-my-world">in-context</a></span>
