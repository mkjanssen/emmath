<div class="para">Alice wants to send a bit of information to her friend Bob; for simplicity’s sake, let’s assume she seeks to send a 0 or 1. To improve the chances that the message is received correctly, she decides to send it three times in a row. So, if Alice desires to send Bob a 1, she’ll actually send 111; if she desires to send a 0, she’ll send 000.</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">As described above, errors can creep into the transmitted messsage; perhaps Alice sends Bob 111 and that is what he receives, but what if he receives 101? Or 100? How should Bob interpet those two (different) messages?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What strengths and weaknesses do you see in Alice’s system? How could you improve the chances that Bob interprets Alice’s message as she intends?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Perhaps you decided that Alice’s system is still too prone to errors, so you decide she should send the intended digit seven times instead of 3. In what way(s) is this revised system better? Worse?</div></li>
