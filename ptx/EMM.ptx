		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world around us. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

			<title>The Cube</title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					We begin our mathematical explorations in a place that may seem unusual.
					The Rubik's Cube, invented<fn>Or, to use Rubik's word, <em>discovered</em>.</fn> in the 1970s by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik, is the best-selling toy of all time.
					It is also a rich mathematical playscape, a tactile means of exploring and challenging our fundamental ideas around what counts as an arithmetic operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Cube's colorful, playful nature also underscores our purpose in beginning by exploring it.
					Specifically, exploring the Cube will help us develop some of the virtues Francis Su identifies in <xref ref="Su2020" /> under the desire of <em>play</em>: exploring the Cube will hopefuly pique your <em>curiosity</em> and build your <em>patience</em> and <em>perseverance</em>.
					Solving it will require you to <em>change perspectives</em> and build <em>confidence in struggle</em>.
					And, I hope, the satisfaction and joy you experience in finally solving it will engender an <em>openness of spirit</em> that we will carry into further explorations for the rest of the text.
				</p>
				<p>
					As we begin, I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of the <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</url></em> project, especially the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/games-and-puzzles">Games and Puzzles</url> book.
					I learned the Rubik's Cube by reading and teaching their work, and it is impossible to overstate their influence on this chapter.

							  <solution>
								  Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.

				<assemblage>
					<title>Motivating Questions</title>
					<p>
						<statement>
							In this section, we will explore the following questions.
							<ol>
								<li>What are faces and layers, and what methods exist for solving them?</li>
								<li>How can we describe a complex series of Cube moves?</li>
								<li>What is the order of a Cube move?</li>	  
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</p>
				</assemblage>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						In this section, we'll define a few terms and work on an initial exploration of the Cube's white layer.
						Then, we'll discuss the need for notation for communicating about our Cubes and introduce some standard notation.
					</p>
				</introduction>
				
				
				
				<subsection>
					<title>Faces and Layers</title>
					
					
					<p>
						We begin with a definition.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-cube-face">
						<index><h>Cube face</h><h>solved</h></index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A <term>face</term> of the Cube refers to one of its sides.
								We say a face is <term>solved</term> if all the stickers on that side are the same color.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					
					<p>
						There are many ways to solve the Cube, and we'll explore one approach later in this chapter.
						A crucial step in learning to solve the Cube is learning to solve one face.
					</p>
					
					<assemblage>
						<title>Challenge</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								Scramble your Cube. Then solve the white face. If you have not done this before (or even if you have), this may take hours or days, not minutes! <emph>Avoid relying on any outside resources</emph> (including websites, friends, etc.). 
								
								When you solve it, congratulations! Then scramble the face and solve it again. Repeat this process until you can reliably do it in just a few minutes. Once you can reliably solve the white face, describe, <emph>in writing</emph>, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can. What challenges did you have to overcome? How did you overcome them?
							</statement>
						</p>
					</assemblage>
					
					<p>
						Congratulations on solving a face of your Cube! But a question comes to mind. 
						When your white face is in its solved state, are all the cubies on the white face in the correct location?
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-cube-layer">
						<index><h>Cube layer</h><h>solved</h></index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A <term>layer</term> of the Cube consists of a face and all of the stickers on Cubies which compose the face.
								A layer is <term>solved</term> if all of the Cubies in the layer are in the correct location with the correct orientation.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
						
					<assemblage>
						<title>Challenge</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								Scramble your Cube and then solve the white layer. As before, this may take hours or days. When you solve it, congratulations! Scramble it and do it again.
								
								Once you can reliably solve the white layer, describe, in writing, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can.
							</statement>
						</p>
					</assemblage>
					
					
				</subsection>
				
				
				
				<subsection>
					<title>The Need for Notation</title>
					
					
					<principle xml:id="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <emph>and without pointing to your Cube</emph> your method for moving a corner cubie to its proper position.
								Similarly, verbally describe your edge cubie to its proper position.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</principle>
					
					<principle xml:id="discussion-written-cubie-moves">
						<statement>
							<p>
								As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail without becoming lost.
								Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing?
								Why or why not?
							</p>
						</statement>
					</principle>
					
					<p>
						Every area of inquiry has an associated collection of terminology and shorthand notation.
						At its best, this terminology enables efficient and clear communication.
						However, terminology can often be a barrier.
						Thus, we want to avoid introducing unnecessary or confusing jargon whenever possible.
						However, as I hope <xref ref="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves" /> and <xref ref="discussion-written-cubie-moves" /> underscore, a lack of terminology or shorthand notation severely impairs our ability to communicate deep technical ideas.
						It is with this background that we introduce the following notation, which has become standard in the Cubing community.<aside>Indeed, it seems no accident of history that Newton and Leibniz's calculus came about <em>after</em> algebraic notation became standardized.</aside>
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-face-names">
						<p>
							Hold the Cube in such a way that you are looking at one of the faces.
							<ul>
								<li>The face you are looking at is referred to as the <term>front</term> (F) face.</li>
								<li>The face on the side opposite the front is referred to as the <term>back</term> (B) face.</li>
								<li>The face on the right side is referred to as the <term>right</term> (R) face.</li>
								<li>The face opposite the right is the <term>left</term> (L) face.</li>
								<li>The face on the top of the Cube is the <term>up</term> (U) face.</li>
								<li>The face on the bottom of the Cube is the <term>down</term> (D) face.</li>
							</ul>
							A graphical version appears in <xref ref="fig-cube-faces" />.

					<activity>
						<statement>
							<p>
								List the colors of each of the six faces in <xref ref="fig-cube-faces" />.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</activity>
					
					<p>
						As we we will see momentarily, the names described in <xref ref="def-face-names" /> not only help us refer to faces, but also moves of the Cube which help us solve it.
						In order to understand what moves do, we will have a need to refer to certain cubies by location.
						The following definition enables this.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-cubie-names">
						<statement>
							<p>
								A cubie is named by the face(s) on which it sits, using lowercase letters.

					</activity>
					
					<p>
						We are most interested in using our new notation to describe <em>moves</em> of the various faces.
						We thus make the following definition.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-face-moves">
						<index><h>Cube move</h><h>face rotation</h></index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A given face name, e.g., <m>R</m>, describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
								A given face name with prime symbol, e.g., <m>R'</m>, denotes a <m>90^\circ</m> counterclockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
								A sequence of face moves is written multiplicatively, left to right.
								We may use parentheses and exponents to write our moves more compactly.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					
					
					
					
					<exploration xml:id="expl-turning-faces">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Consider the following questions in the context of a completely solved cube as pictured in <xref ref="fig-solved-cube" />.

					<title>Order</title>
					
					<p>
						A useful algebraic concept for describing Cube moves is that of <em>order</em>.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-order">
						<index><h>Cube move</h><h>order</h></index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								The <term>order</term> of a cube move <m>M</m> is the least number of times <m>n \gt 1</m> that <m>M</m> can be repeated before a solved Cube is solved again.
								We write <m>|M| = n</m>.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					
					<example>
						<statement>
							<p>
								The order of <m>R</m> is 4, since 4 clockwise quarter-turns of the right face of a solved Cube results in a solved Cube, and no fewer number of turns results in a solved Cube.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</example>
					
					<exploration>
						<statement>
							<ol>
								<li>What is <m>|U^2|</m>?</li>
								<li>Calculate <m>|R^3|</m>. Why does this make sense?</li>
								<li>Calculate <m>|RUR^{-1} U^{-1}|</m>?</li>

					<title>Conclusion</title>
					<p>
						In this section, we began a systematic exploration of the properties of the Cube.
						First, we described the need for a notational shorthand for describing our approaches to solving the white face and layer.
					</p>
					<p>
						The standard notation refers to each face <em>as you look at it</em>, ignoring color, and describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of the face. 
						So, <m>FR</m> means to first turn the front face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise, then the right face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise.
						We then noted that we can refer to a cubie by describing the face(s) on which it sits (using lowercase letters to distinguish cubies from faces): three letters refer to a corner, as it sits at the intersection of three faces; two letters refer to an edge, and one to a center.
					</p>
					<p>
						We concluded by introducing the idea of order, which will help us analyze and understand more complex sequences of Cube moves in the next section.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Our goal in this chapter is to explore, and eventually solve, the Cube.
						To do this, every cubie must be in the correct <em>location</em> with the correct <em>orientation</em>.
						In this section, we focus on two moves which will allow us to put the cubies in the correct location.
						Once they are in the correct location, we'll see moves in the next section which will enable us to orient them correctly, enabling us to (finally) solve the Cube.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In <xref ref="sec-play-moving-cubies" />, we considered ways of moving certain edge and corner cubies.
						The key that allows us to use <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and <xref ref="cube-move-er" /> to put your cubies in the correct location is that, when executed correctly, they affect precisely three cubies each, leaving the rest in the same place with the same orientation at the end of the move.
					</p>
					<p>
						As we embark on learning our last two Cube moves, it's worth taking some time to practice what we already know.
						Each unsolved Cube is a puzzle, solvable by clever application of these moves.

							<li>Put the edges in the correct <em>location</em>.</li>

				<title>Conclusion</title>
					<p>
						In this section, we explored the last moves we need to solve the Cube. 
						We also described a strategy for solving the Cube. 
						Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn.
						The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are advantages and disadvantages to all solution methods.
						Advantages to corners-first are:
						<ul>
							<li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
							<li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
							<li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
							<li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>
						</ul>
