		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world around us. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

		<title>The Cube</title>
		
		<introduction>
			<p>
				We begin our mathematical explorations in a place that may seem unusual.
				The Rubik's Cube, invented<fn>Or, to use Rubik's word, <em>discovered</em>.</fn> in the 1970s by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik, is the best-selling toy of all time.
				It is also a rich mathematical playscape, a tactile means of exploring and challenging our fundamental ideas around what counts as an arithmetic operation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cube's colorful, playful nature also underscores our purpose in beginning with it.
				Specifically, exploring the Cube will help us develop some of the virtues Francis Su identifies in <xref ref="Su2020" /> under the desire of <em>play</em>: exploring the Cube will hopefuly pique your <em>curiosity</em> and build your <em>patience</em> and <em>perseverance</em>.
				Solving it will require you to <em>change perspectives</em> and build <em>confidence in struggle</em>.
				And, I hope, the satisfaction and joy you experience in finally solving it will engender an <em>openness of spirit</em> that we will carry into further explorations for the rest of the text.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we begin, I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of the <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</url></em> project, especially the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/games-and-puzzles">Games and Puzzles</url> book.
				I learned the Rubik's Cube by reading and teaching their work, and it is impossible to overstate their influence on this chapter.

						  <p>
							  <statement>
								  First, introduce yourself to the members of your group. Then, consider the questions:
								  <ol>
									  <li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li> 
									  <li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>

					  <p>
							The Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga identified four elements of play: it should be <em>voluntary</em>; it should be distinct from ordinary life, taking place within its circumscribed time and locality, since dubbed the <q>magic circle</q>; and it, like a game of chess or solve of a Rubik's cube, can be repeated.
						</p>
						<p>
						  It is the goal of this text to make mathematics playful, inasmuch as is possible.
						  We recognize that you may be reading this for a class which was not voluntary, and you are constrained in your mathematical play by the requirements put upon you by your instructor.
						  However, we encourage you to approach not only the solution of the Rubik's cube from a playful posture, but subsequent explorations as well.

								<investigation xml:id="invest-firstquestionsaboutthecube">
									<statement>
									<p>
										In your groups, investigate your Cubes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? Make a list of as many observations and questions as you can, and write them in your notes.

										<p>
											The little cubes which make up the Cube are often called <term>cubies</term>. The cubies located at the corners are imaginatively called <term>corner cubies</term>, the cubies located at the centers <term>center cubies</term>, and the others <term>edge cubies</term>.
											</p>
									</statement>
								</definition>
					
								<investigation xml:id="invest-corner-cubies">
									<statement>
										<p>
											In this investigation we'll consider the corner cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.
											<ol>
												<li>How many corners are there?</li>
												<li>How many stickers does a corner cubie have?</li>
												<li>Can you move a corner cubie to a position other than a corner? Explain your reasoning.</li>

											As always, make sure you can explain your answers.
										</p>
					<image xml:id="moving-corner-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
									</statement>
									<solution>
										There are 8 corners, with three stickers each. Since all corners have three stickers, and other cubies have fewer stickers, we can't move a corner cubie to any location other than another corner. But we <em>can</em> move a given corner to any other corner.

											  How can you tell when a cubie is in the correct <em>location</em>? How can you tell when it is <em>oriented</em> correctly? Is there a difference?<fn>Does it depend on the cubie?</fn>
										  </statement>
					
									  </p>
									<solution>
										Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.

				<title>Motivating Questions</title>
				<p>
					<statement>
						In this section, we will explore the following questions.
						<ol>
							<li>What are faces and layers, and what methods exist for solving them?</li>
							<li>How can we describe a complex series of Cube moves?</li>
							<li>What is the order of a Cube move?</li>	  
						</ol>
					</statement>
				</p>
			</assemblage>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In this section, we'll define a few terms and work on an initial exploration of the Cube's white layer.
					Then, we'll discuss the need for a precise method communicating about our Cubes, and introduce some standard notation.
				</p>
			</introduction>
			
			
			
			<subsection>
				<title>Faces and Layers</title>
				
				
				<p>
					We begin with a definition.
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cube-face">
					<index><h>Cube face</h><h>solved</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A <term>face</term> of the Cube refers to one of its sides.
							We say a face is <term>solved</term> if all the stickers on that side are the same color.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				
				<p>
					There are many ways to solve the Cube, and we'll explore one approach later in this chapter.
					A crucial step in learning to solve the Cube is learning to solve one face.
				</p>
				
				<assemblage>
					<title>Challenge</title>
					<p>
						<statement>
							Scramble your Cube. Then solve the white face. If you have not done this before (or even if you have), this may take hours or days, not minutes! <emph>Avoid relying on any outside resources</emph> (including websites, friends, etc.). 
							
							When you solve it, congratulations! Then scramble the face and solve it again. Repeat this process until you can reliably do it in just a few minutes. Once you can reliably solve the white face, describe, <emph>in writing</emph>, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can. What challenges did you have to overcome? How did you overcome them?
						</statement>
					</p>
				</assemblage>
				
				<p>
					Congratulations on solving a face of your Cube! But a question comes to mind. 
					When your white face is in its solved state, are all the cubies on the white face in the correct location?
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cube-layer">
					<index><h>Cube layer</h><h>solved</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A <term>layer</term> of the Cube consists of a face and all of the stickers on Cubies which compose the face.
							A layer is <term>solved</term> if all of the Cubies in the layer are in the correct location with the correct orientation.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
					
				<assemblage>
					<title>Challenge</title>
					<p>
						<statement>
							Scramble your Cube and then solve the white layer. As before, this may take hours or days. When you solve it, congratulations! Scramble it and do it again.
							
							Once you can reliably solve the white layer, describe, in writing, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can.
						</statement>
					</p>
				</assemblage>

			<subsection>
				<title>The Need for Notation</title>
				
				
				<principle xml:id="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <emph>and without pointing to your Cube</emph> your method for moving a corner cubie to its proper position.
							Similarly, verbally describe your method for moving an edge cubie to its proper position.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<principle xml:id="discussion-written-cubie-moves">
					<statement>
						<p>
							As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail without becoming lost.
							Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing?
							Why or why not?
						</p>
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<p>
					Every area of inquiry has an associated collection of terminology and shorthand notation.
					At its best, this terminology enables efficient and clear communication.
					However, terminology can often be a barrier.
					Thus, we want to avoid introducing unnecessary or confusing jargon whenever possible.
					However, as I hope <xref ref="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves" /> and <xref ref="discussion-written-cubie-moves" /> underscore, a lack of terminology or shorthand notation severely impairs our ability to communicate deep technical ideas.
					It is with this background that we introduce the following notation, which has become standard in the Cubing community.<aside>Indeed, it seems no accident of history that Newton and Leibniz's calculus came about <em>after</em> algebraic notation became standardized.</aside>
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-face-names">
					<p>
						Hold the Cube in such a way that you are looking at one of the faces.
						<ul>
							<li>The face you are looking at is referred to as the <term>front</term> (F) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the side opposite the front is referred to as the <term>back</term> (B) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the right side is referred to as the <term>right</term> (R) face.</li>
							<li>The face opposite the right is the <term>left</term> (L) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the top of the Cube is the <term>up</term> (U) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the bottom of the Cube is the <term>down</term> (D) face.</li>

					<statement>
						<p>
							List the colors of each of the six faces in <xref ref="fig-cube-faces" />.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</activity>
				
				<p>
					As we we will see momentarily, the names described in <xref ref="def-face-names" /> not only help us refer to faces, but also moves of the Cube which help us solve it.
					In order to understand what a given move does to the Cube, we will need to refer to certain cubies by location.
					The following definition enables this.
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cubie-names">

					We are most interested in using our new notation to describe <em>moves</em> of the various faces.

					<index><h>Cube move</h><h>face rotation</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A given face name, e.g., <m>R</m>, describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
							A given face name with prime symbol, e.g., <m>R'</m>, denotes a <m>90^\circ</m> counterclockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
							A sequence of face moves is written multiplicatively, left to right.
							We may use parentheses and exponents to write our moves more compactly.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				
				
				
				
				<exploration xml:id="expl-turning-faces">
					<statement>
						<p>

				<title>Conclusion</title>
				<p>
					In this section, we began a systematic exploration of the properties of the Cube.
					First, we described the need for a notational shorthand in solving the white face and layer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The standard notation refers to each face <em>as you look at it</em>, ignoring color, and describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of the face. 
					So, <m>FR</m> means to first turn the front face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise, then the right face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise.
					We then noted that we can refer to a cubie by describing the face(s) on which it sits (using lowercase letters to distinguish cubies from faces): three letters refer to a corner, as it sits at the intersection of three faces; two letters refer to an edge, and one to a center.
				</p>
				<p>
					We concluded by introducing the idea of order, which will help us analyze and understand more complex sequences of Cube moves in the next section.

				<p>
					Our goal in this chapter is to explore, and eventually solve, the Cube.
					To do this, every cubie must be in the correct <em>location</em> with the correct <em>orientation</em>.
					In this section, we focus on two moves which will allow us to put the cubies in the correct location.
					Once they are in the correct location, we'll see moves in the next section which will help us orient them correctly, enabling us to (finally) solve the Cube.

			<introduction>
				<p>
					In <xref ref="sec-play-moving-cubies" />, we considered ways of moving certain edge and corner cubies.
					The key that allows us to use <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and <xref ref="cube-move-er" /> to put your cubies in the correct location is that each move affects precisely three cubies.
					All others are left unmoved. 
					By using just <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and <xref ref="cube-move-er" />, we can thus put each cubie in the correct location.
					However, even if a cubie is in the correct location, it may be that its stickers are on the wrong faces<mdash />in this case, it needs to be <em>reoriented</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this section, we will see how to reorient cubies once they are in the correct location.
					To do so, we'll learn two moves: one that reorients corners, and one that reorients edges.
					Once we are able to put each cubie in the correct location, and then orient it correctly, each scrambled Cube becomes a puzzle, solvable by clever application of these moves.

			<title>Conclusion</title>
				<p>
					In this section, we explored the last moves we need to solve the Cube. 
					We also described a strategy for solving the Cube. 
					Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn.
					The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are advantages and disadvantages to all solution methods.
					Advantages to corners-first are:
					<ul>
						<li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
						<li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
						<li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
						<li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>

			<title>Truth</title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					As Su identifies in <xref ref="Su2020" />, humans have an innate desire for truth.
					Defining just what we mean by <term>truth</term> is tricky, so we'll follow Su's lead and just say that <q>true statements are ones that align with reality</q>.
					In an age of rampant disinformation, we seek to know what is actually true.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth.
					One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. 
					Yet, mathematics is a human endeavor; and what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being <q>true</q>, anyway? 
					The answer might surprise you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this unit, we'll explore inductive and deductive reasoning, as well as formal logic. 
					We'll explore the shortcomings of mathematical thinking in addition to its strengths.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This chapter is heavily influenced by <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/truth-reasoning-certainty-and-proof">Discovering the Art of Mathematics: Truth, Reasoning, Certainty, and Proof</url></em> by Fleron, Hotchkiss, Ecke, and von Renesse.

								<em>Truth</em> refers to propositions which are correct and valid for all time, places, and people. It never changes. <em>Facts</em> refer to propositions supported by evidence. They are subject to change based on new evidence.

								Muslims do not.

						The work of the guesser in <xref ref="act-whats-my-world" /> is to employ inductive reasoning to determine the general law put in place by the creator.

						<statement>
							<p>
								Let's play a game with dots and lines. 
								We'll start with at least two dots (though you'll probably want to increase this number pretty quickly).
								The rules are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Split your dots into two groups, group <m>A</m> and group <m>B</m>, and draw each group on its own line.</li>
								<li>Connect (some of) the dots from <m>A</m> to (some of) the dots in <m>B</m> with lines. The lines don't have to be straight<mdash />they can curve in any way you want!<mdash />but each line should connect precisely two dots: one from <m>A</m> and one from <m>B</m>.</li>
								<li>Each dot should be connected to at least one other dot<mdash />no lonely dots!</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								So, if I label four dots as <m>X, Y, Z, W</m>, <em>one possible</em> drawing is given in <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" />.
							</p>
							<figure xml:id="fig-dot-game-example">

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The lines can be drawn so that none of them cross.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Now consider the following questions.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Redraw the picture in <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" /> so that none of the lines cross.</li>
								<li>Give a name to drawings of figures like <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" /> which <em>can</em> be drawn so that none of the lines cross.</li>
								<li>Which drawings are possible with two or three dots? Can they be drawn to have the property that none of the lines cross?</li>
								<li>What other drawings are possible with four dots? Five?</li>
								<li>Based on your work here, do you think it will always be possible to draw these pictures so that none of the lines cross? Explain your thinking.</li>

						Formal mathematical reasoning is deductive (defined momentarily), and begins with <term>axioms</term>, which are statements that should be self-evident and taken to be true.
						Note that while axioms are not always explicitly stated, they <em>can</em> be when necessary.
					</p>
					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
						<p>
							The most famous set of axioms are Euclid's postulates for geometry, defined in <em><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements">The Elements</url></em>, which not only shaped thousands of years of geometry, but solidified the deductive approach to doing and explaining mathematics that we will explore in this unit.
							At the beginning of Book I of <em>The Elements</em>, Euclid identified five postulates and five axioms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Euclid's <em>postulates</em> are:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</li>
							<li>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</li>

								They should be as simple as possible; all except Euclid's fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) are considered quite straightforward.
								The parallel postulate has a fascinating history; it turns out be independent of the other postulates, and one can create new geometries (on the surface of a sphere, for instance), by rejecting it.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are lots of unproved assumptions that we make in life.
								Many Christian mathematicians make explicit that they view the authority of Scripture as an axiom; they can't use logic to conclusively deduce that Scripture is the only authority for Christian faith and life, but they <em>assume</em> it in order to draw conclusions <em>about</em> faith and life.

						The process of <term>deductive reasoning</term> in mathematics begins from a set of generally agreed-upon axioms of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory">set theory</url><fn>It should be noted that there is disagreement about the Axiom of Choice, mostly due to some of its surprising consequences.</fn> and uses logic to make inevitable conclusions from those axioms. These conclusions are generally called <term>theorems</term>. They are usually given as conditional statements of the form <q>If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>,</q> where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are sensible<aside>For some definition of the word <q>sensible</q>.</aside> statements.
						Moreover, since most deductive statements are presented in conditional form, their scope is generally limited.
						That is, the statement <q>if it is Monday, then we have math class</q> is only making a claim about what happens on Mondays; it says nothing whatsoever about any other day of the week.

						The author Lewis Carroll loved logic puzzles (he was actually a mathematics professor!), and wrote many of them. Here is one, axiomatized for easy reference.
					</p>
	
					
					<axiom xml:id="axiom-kittens">
						<title>(Carroll)</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Consider the axioms:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>If a kitten loves fish, then it is teachable.</li>
								<li>Every kitten without a tail will play with a gorilla.</li>
								<li>All kittens with whiskers love fish.</li>
								<li>If a kitten has green eyes, then it is not teachable.</li>
								<li>All kittens have whiskers or do not have tails.</li>
							</ol>
							
						</statement>
					</axiom>
					
					<p>
						Once you have a deductive argument that (generally) begins from your premises and reasons, step-by-step, to your conclusion, you can write out the argument in a short essay known as a <em>proof</em>.
						For our purposes, a proof is just a <em>convicing argument</em>.
						It should be written at a level appropriate to the reader and clearly lay out the steps necessary for a reader who accepts your hypotheses to believe the conclusion.
						As an example, consider the following.
					</p>
					
					<example xml:id="example-kitten-deduction">
						<statement>
							<p>
								All kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
							<p>
								<term>Proof</term>. Suppose we have a kitten with whiskers. Let's call him Arthur. By <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #3, Arthur loves fish. Since Arthur loves fish, <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #1 implies that Arthur is teachable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since Arthur was an arbitrary kitten, we conclude that all kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</example>
					
					<p>
						There are several observations which are worth a moment of our time in the proof in <xref ref="example-kitten-deduction" />.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We first note that the proof is written using standard conventions of academic writing, including complete sentences, proper punctuation and capitalization, etc. This is important! In order to convince someone that your argument is valid, they need to be able to read it.</li>
						<li>While the statement to be proved is not written as <q>if <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m></q>, it <em>can</em> be stated that way: <q>If <m>A</m> is a kitten with whiskers, then <m>A</m> is teachable</q>. Thus, our proof begins by considering an arbitrary kitten with whiskers, who we name Arthur. We observe, however, that there is nothing special about Arthur that figures into our proof in a meaningful way, so the argument will apply just as well to any kitten with whiskers we may find.</li>
						<li>In each step we take throughout the proof, we refer to the specific axiom from <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> that allow us to take that step. It is valuable to be able to do this, but generally we do not specifically refer to the axioms by number. This is to improve the readability of the proof.</li>
						<li>Finally, note that our proof concludes with a conclusion: all kittens with whiskers are teachable. This is good practice and sends an unmistakable signal to the reader that you are done.</li>
					</ul>

						Now, prove the theorems that follow using <xref ref="axiom-kittens" />.

						<title>Conclusion</title>
						<p>
							In this section, we explored deductive reasoning, which begins from accepted axioms and premises and then reasons, step by logical step, toward a conclusion.
							This is the primary form of reasoning used in mathematics.
							We saw that while conclusions reached via deductive reasoning are generally tighter and more certain, there are still some drawbacks.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main drawback of deductive reasoning involves scope.
							We must begin with axioms, so the axioms must be well-chosen and sensible.
							However, if one disagrees with the choice of a set of axioms, then one must be willing to set aside any results deduced from them (or, at least, deduced from the particular axioms with which one disagrees).
						</p>
						<p>
							A second drawback having to do with scope concerns the premises of a conditional statement.
							In particular, if the premises of a statement are not satisfied, the statement makes no assertion whatsoever 
							(though, as we will see in <xref ref="chap-logic" />, there is still a <em>consistent</em> way to assign truth values to statements whose premises are not satisfied).

				<title>Modern Mathematical Logic</title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						In <xref ref="chap-reasoning" />, we explored two types of reasoning: inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning.
						The type of reasoning used most often in mathematics is deductive reasoning.
						In the late 19th/early 20th century, logic itself was mathematized by the likes of George Boole and Augustus De Morgan into a <em>propositional calculus</em>.
						This gave mathematicians a means of determining the truth value of a statement purely based on its inherent logical structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is this method of calculating that we explore in this chapter.
					</p>

						<title>Motivating Questions</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								In this section, we will explore the following questions.
								<ol>
									<li>What is a proposition?</li>
									<li>What are logical connectives? How can they be used to build new propositions?</li>
									<li>What does it mean for two propositions to be logically equivalent?</li>	  
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</p>
					</assemblage>
					
					
					
					<p>
						In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematicians began mathematize and formalize logic itself. Today we begin to explore these foundational issues. We'll start with some definitions.
					</p>
		
					
					<definition>
						<index>proposition</index>
						<index><h>proposition</h><h>elementary</h></index>
						<index>logical connectives</index>
						<p>
							A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence which is either true or false, but not both.
							An <term>elementary proposition</term> is a sentence with a subject and a verb, but no connectives (such as <em>and, or, not, if-then,</em> or <em>if-and-only-if</em>).
						</p>
		
					</definition>
					
					<activity xml:id="act-propositions">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Determine which of the following are propositions (elementary or otherwise).
								If a given sentence is a proposition, determine its truth value.
								If it isn't, explain why not.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Erik Hoekstra is the president of Dordt University.</li>
								<li>The square root of a whole number is always a whole number.</li>
								<li>The Green Bay Packers are the worst football team.</li>
								<li>Why is this class so much fun?</li>
								<li>This sentence is false.</li>
								<li>A group of crows is called a murder.</li>
								<li>Everyone likes cats.</li>
							</ol>
		
						</statement>
						
						<solution>
							<ol>
								<li>This is a true proposition.</li>
								<li>This is a false proposition. As an example, <m>\sqrt{21}</m> is not a whole number.</li>
								<li>This one is harder (though it's an easy "true" from your instructor). But it's likely either a false proposition (due to the Packers not having the worst record in the league) or not a proposition at all, as agreement with the sentence is a matter of subjective taste.</li>
								<li>This is an interrogative, not a declaration.</li>
								<li>This is a declarative sentence, but it's neither true nor false; it's a paradox.</li>
								<li>This is a true proposition! Who knew?</li>
								<li>This is a false proposition.</li>
							</ol>
		
						</solution>
		
		
					</activity>
					
					<p>
						Now that we have a sense for what a proposition is, we'll take old propositions and make new ones using <em>logical connectives</em>.
						In order to describe how the connectives work, mathematicians define the truth values of the new propositions <em>formally</em><mdash />that is, without regard to the content of the propositions themselves<mdash />in terms of the possible combinations of truth values from the constituent propositions.
						This gives us an abstract way of considering the truth values of propositions.

							We have now explored several ways of combining existing propositions into larger propositions using logical connectives.
							When we use logic to write proofs, we also employ tools known as <em>rules of inference</em>.
							They clearly describe what steps we are allowed to take.
							There are many such rules; we will highlight two.
						</p>
			 
						<p>
							The way in which reasoning with implications is often done uses a rule of inference known as <term>modus ponens</term> which runs roughly:

							<li><m>P</m>,</li>
							<li>Therefore, <m>Q</m></li>

							A closely related rule of inference is known as <term>modus tollens</term>, and runs thusly:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>.</li>

						<title>Motivating Questions</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								In this section, we will explore the following questions.
								<ol>
									<li>What are formal systems?</li>
									<li>What was Hilbert's goal? How was it resolved?</li>
									<li>How did Cantor describe infinite sets?</li>

						<title>Formal Systems</title>
					
						<p>
							We have seen thus far a way of formalizing logic so that we can think about the truth of a statement purely syntactically (structurally) without regard for the semantic meaning of the statements under consideration.
							In the late 19th century, mathematicians developed what became known as <term>formal systems</term>, consisting of axioms, which were strings of symbols, such as
							<me>
								\exists B \forall C, (C\in B \Leftrightarrow C\subseteq A),
							</me>
							along with a <term>logical calculus</term>, which govern the rules of inference that can be used on the axioms to deduce new theorems.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Further, mathematicians had long assumed there were consistent foundational axioms for their discipline.
							Newly discovered paradoxes challenged this view.
						</p>
						<exploration>
							<title>Russell's Paradox</title>
							<p>
								In a certain town lives a barber who only cuts the hair of <em>all</em> people who do not cut their own hair.
								Who cuts the barber's hair?
							</p>
	<!-- 						<solution>
								<p>
									This is a paradox: if the barber cuts his own hair, we reach a contradiction, as he only cuts the hair of those who do not cut their own hair. On the other hand, if the barber does not cut his own hair, he does by definition.
								</p>
								<p>
									This sort of self-referential paradox is exactly the sort that we'll study later in this section that led to the foundational crisis referred to in the section title.
								</p>
							</solution> -->
						</exploration>
						
						<p>
							Two main schools of mathematical philosophy sprung up in the wake of these discoveries.
							The <term>formalists</term> argued that statements of mathematics and logic are really just about the rules and consequences for manipulating symbols and strings of letters.
							That is, mathematics does not have a subject matter at all--just empty symbols, which may be given an interpretation in particular situations and thus have meaning.
						</p>
						<p>
							The response came from the <term>intuitionists</term>.
							Intuitionism is an approach that consideres mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of any principles which we can reasonably claim exist in an objective reality.
							Thus, in some sense, mathematics is up to whoever is doing the mathematics.
							To the intuitionists, the formalists were reducing mathematics to a meaningless game with symbols.
						</p>
						
						<principle>
							<p>
								Do you resonate more with a formalist approach to mathematics, or an intuitionist approach?
								Relatedly: do you believe mathematics is something humans invent, or something we discover in the world around us?
								Why?
							</p>
						</principle>

							In 1900, at the second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert posed 23 theretofore unanswered problems in mathematics that he thought were important to guide the development of mathematics in the 20th century.
							We've already seen one of them (the 8th): the Goldbach conjecture.
							Most of Hilbert's problems have been solved, but three are unresolved, two are thought to be too vague to ever get consensus on what a solution would look like, and one is the subject of much debate.
						</p>
						<p>					
							In an attempt to resolve the issues raised by paradoxes like Russell's Paradox, Hilbert posed this problem, the second on the list:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results….
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>
							That is, Hilbert wanted mathematicians to prove that the axioms on which mathematics was founded did not lead to a contradiction.
							The resolution to this problem is surprising, and to begin to explore it, we will turn to the infinite.

							<p>
								In <xref ref="subsec-formal-systems" />, we learned about the push from mathematicians in the late 19th/early 20th century were trying to show that the axioms, the very foundations on which mathematics was built, were both <em>complete</em> (the truth of every sensible statement could be decided via deductions from the axioms) and <em>consistent</em> (one could never deduce contradictory statements from the axioms).
							</p>
							
							<p>
								For reasons which are hopefully clear, we'll assume that the axioms are consistent, that is, no contradictions will arise from them. (If contradictions <em>can</em> arise, we are in trouble indeed.)
								But if the axioms are consistent, can it be shown that they're complete?
								To answer this question, we dive into the realm of infinity.

								<index>incompleteness theorems</index>
								In the early 1930s, the Austrian mathematical logician Kurt Godel revolutionized mathematical logic with his two <term>incompleteness theorems</term>.
								Informally, first incompleteness theorem states that any sufficiently strong, consistent formal system contains undecidable statements.
								That is, there are sensible statements, such as the one raised in <xref ref="disc-ch" />, which cannot be proved from within the system.
								In that case, we may choose to adopt either the statement <em>or its negation</em> as an additional axiom, and may do so without creating any contradiction.
							</p>
							<p>
								The question in <xref ref="disc-ch" /> leads to just such a proposition, namely that no such set <m>S</m> exists.
								This has been known as the <term>continuum hypothesis</term>.
								It was first suggested by Cantor in 1878, and was one of Hilbert's 23 problems.
								Godel himself proved in 1940 that its negation, i.e., that such a set <m>S</m> does exist, is independent of the usual axioms of set theory.
								The mathematician Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that the continuum hypothesis itself is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, thus verifying that the hypothesis is undecidable.

									The existence of undecidable statements in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, may seem like an esoteric quirk without any real consequences.
