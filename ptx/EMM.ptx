		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world around us. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

		<title>The Cube</title>
		
		<introduction>
			<p>
				We begin our mathematical explorations in a place that may seem unusual.
				The Rubik's Cube, invented<fn>Or, to use Rubik's word, <em>discovered</em>.</fn> in the 1970s by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik, is the best-selling toy of all time.
				It is also a rich mathematical playscape, a tactile means of exploring and challenging our fundamental ideas around what counts as an arithmetic operation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cube's colorful, playful nature also underscores our purpose in beginning with it.
				Specifically, exploring the Cube will help us develop some of the virtues Francis Su identifies in <xref ref="Su2020" /> under the desire of <em>play</em>: exploring the Cube will hopefuly pique your <em>curiosity</em> and build your <em>patience</em> and <em>perseverance</em>.
				Solving it will require you to <em>change perspectives</em> and build <em>confidence in struggle</em>.
				And, I hope, the satisfaction and joy you experience in finally solving it will engender an <em>openness of spirit</em> that we will carry into further explorations for the rest of the text.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we begin, I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of the <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</url></em> project, especially the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/games-and-puzzles">Games and Puzzles</url> book.
				I learned the Rubik's Cube by reading and teaching their work, and it is impossible to overstate their influence on this chapter.

						  <p>
							  <statement>
								  First, introduce yourself to the members of your group. Then, consider the questions:
								  <ol>
									  <li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li> 
									  <li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>

					  <p>
							The Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga identified four elements of play: it should be <em>voluntary</em>; it should be distinct from ordinary life, taking place within its circumscribed time and locality, since dubbed the <q>magic circle</q>; and it, like a game of chess or solve of a Rubik's cube, can be repeated.
						</p>
						<p>
						  It is the goal of this text to make mathematics playful, inasmuch as is possible.
						  We recognize that you may be reading this for a class which was not voluntary, and you are constrained in your mathematical play by the requirements put upon you by your instructor.
						  However, we encourage you to approach not only the solution of the Rubik's cube from a playful posture, but subsequent explorations as well.

								<investigation xml:id="invest-firstquestionsaboutthecube">
									<statement>
									<p>
										In your groups, investigate your Cubes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? Make a list of as many observations and questions as you can, and write them in your notes.

										<p>
											The little cubes which make up the Cube are often called <term>cubies</term>. The cubies located at the corners are imaginatively called <term>corner cubies</term>, the cubies located at the centers <term>center cubies</term>, and the others <term>edge cubies</term>.
											</p>
									</statement>
								</definition>
					
								<investigation xml:id="invest-corner-cubies">
									<statement>
										<p>
											In this investigation we'll consider the corner cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.
											<ol>
												<li>How many corners are there?</li>
												<li>How many stickers does a corner cubie have?</li>
												<li>Can you move a corner cubie to a position other than a corner? Explain your reasoning.</li>

											As always, make sure you can explain your answers.
										</p>
					<image xml:id="moving-corner-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
									</statement>
									<solution>
										There are 8 corners, with three stickers each. Since all corners have three stickers, and other cubies have fewer stickers, we can't move a corner cubie to any location other than another corner. But we <em>can</em> move a given corner to any other corner.

											  How can you tell when a cubie is in the correct <em>location</em>? How can you tell when it is <em>oriented</em> correctly? Is there a difference?<fn>Does it depend on the cubie?</fn>
										  </statement>
					
									  </p>
									<solution>
										Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.

				<title>Motivating Questions</title>
				<p>
					<statement>
						In this section, we will explore the following questions.
						<ol>
							<li>What are faces and layers, and what methods exist for solving them?</li>
							<li>How can we describe a complex series of Cube moves?</li>
							<li>What is the order of a Cube move?</li>	  
						</ol>
					</statement>
				</p>
			</assemblage>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In this section, we'll define a few terms and work on an initial exploration of the Cube's white layer.
					Then, we'll discuss the need for a precise method communicating about our Cubes, and introduce some standard notation.
				</p>
			</introduction>
			
			
			
			<subsection>
				<title>Faces and Layers</title>
				
				
				<p>
					We begin with a definition.
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cube-face">
					<index><h>Cube face</h><h>solved</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A <term>face</term> of the Cube refers to one of its sides.
							We say a face is <term>solved</term> if all the stickers on that side are the same color.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				
				<p>
					There are many ways to solve the Cube, and we'll explore one approach later in this chapter.
					A crucial step in learning to solve the Cube is learning to solve one face.
				</p>
				
				<assemblage>
					<title>Challenge</title>
					<p>
						<statement>
							Scramble your Cube. Then solve the white face. If you have not done this before (or even if you have), this may take hours or days, not minutes! <emph>Avoid relying on any outside resources</emph> (including websites, friends, etc.). 
							
							When you solve it, congratulations! Then scramble the face and solve it again. Repeat this process until you can reliably do it in just a few minutes. Once you can reliably solve the white face, describe, <emph>in writing</emph>, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can. What challenges did you have to overcome? How did you overcome them?
						</statement>
					</p>
				</assemblage>
				
				<p>
					Congratulations on solving a face of your Cube! But a question comes to mind. 
					When your white face is in its solved state, are all the cubies on the white face in the correct location?
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cube-layer">
					<index><h>Cube layer</h><h>solved</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A <term>layer</term> of the Cube consists of a face and all of the stickers on Cubies which compose the face.
							A layer is <term>solved</term> if all of the Cubies in the layer are in the correct location with the correct orientation.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
					
				<assemblage>
					<title>Challenge</title>
					<p>
						<statement>
							Scramble your Cube and then solve the white layer. As before, this may take hours or days. When you solve it, congratulations! Scramble it and do it again.
							
							Once you can reliably solve the white layer, describe, in writing, your methods as clearly and precisely as you can.
						</statement>
					</p>
				</assemblage>

			<subsection>
				<title>The Need for Notation</title>
				
				
				<principle xml:id="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <emph>and without pointing to your Cube</emph> your method for moving a corner cubie to its proper position.
							Similarly, verbally describe your method for moving an edge cubie to its proper position.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<principle xml:id="discussion-written-cubie-moves">
					<statement>
						<p>
							As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail without becoming lost.
							Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing?
							Why or why not?
						</p>
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<p>
					Every area of inquiry has an associated collection of terminology and shorthand notation.
					At its best, this terminology enables efficient and clear communication.
					However, terminology can often be a barrier.
					Thus, we want to avoid introducing unnecessary or confusing jargon whenever possible.
					However, as I hope <xref ref="discussion-verbal-cubie-moves" /> and <xref ref="discussion-written-cubie-moves" /> underscore, a lack of terminology or shorthand notation severely impairs our ability to communicate deep technical ideas.
					It is with this background that we introduce the following notation, which has become standard in the Cubing community.<aside>Indeed, it seems no accident of history that Newton and Leibniz's calculus came about <em>after</em> algebraic notation became standardized.</aside>
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-face-names">
					<p>
						Hold the Cube in such a way that you are looking at one of the faces.
						<ul>
							<li>The face you are looking at is referred to as the <term>front</term> (F) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the side opposite the front is referred to as the <term>back</term> (B) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the right side is referred to as the <term>right</term> (R) face.</li>
							<li>The face opposite the right is the <term>left</term> (L) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the top of the Cube is the <term>up</term> (U) face.</li>
							<li>The face on the bottom of the Cube is the <term>down</term> (D) face.</li>

					<statement>
						<p>
							List the colors of each of the six faces in <xref ref="fig-cube-faces" />.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</activity>
				
				<p>
					As we we will see momentarily, the names described in <xref ref="def-face-names" /> not only help us refer to faces, but also moves of the Cube which help us solve it.
					In order to understand what a given move does to the Cube, we will need to refer to certain cubies by location.
					The following definition enables this.
				</p>
				
				<definition xml:id="def-cubie-names">

					We are most interested in using our new notation to describe <em>moves</em> of the various faces.

					<index><h>Cube move</h><h>face rotation</h></index>
					<statement>
						<p>
							A given face name, e.g., <m>R</m>, describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
							A given face name with prime symbol, e.g., <m>R'</m>, denotes a <m>90^\circ</m> counterclockwise turn of that face, <em>as you look at the face</em>.
							A sequence of face moves is written multiplicatively, left to right.
							We may use parentheses and exponents to write our moves more compactly.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				
				
				
				
				<exploration xml:id="expl-turning-faces">
					<statement>
						<p>

				<title>Conclusion</title>
				<p>
					In this section, we began a systematic exploration of the properties of the Cube.
					First, we described the need for a notational shorthand in solving the white face and layer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The standard notation refers to each face <em>as you look at it</em>, ignoring color, and describes a <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise turn of the face. 
					So, <m>FR</m> means to first turn the front face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise, then the right face <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise.
					We then noted that we can refer to a cubie by describing the face(s) on which it sits (using lowercase letters to distinguish cubies from faces): three letters refer to a corner, as it sits at the intersection of three faces; two letters refer to an edge, and one to a center.
				</p>
				<p>
					We concluded by introducing the idea of order, which will help us analyze and understand more complex sequences of Cube moves in the next section.

				<p>
					Our goal in this chapter is to explore, and eventually solve, the Cube.
					To do this, every cubie must be in the correct <em>location</em> with the correct <em>orientation</em>.
					In this section, we focus on two moves which will allow us to put the cubies in the correct location.
					Once they are in the correct location, we'll see moves in the next section which will help us orient them correctly, enabling us to (finally) solve the Cube.

			<introduction>
				<p>
					In <xref ref="sec-play-moving-cubies" />, we considered ways of moving certain edge and corner cubies.
					The key that allows us to use <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and <xref ref="cube-move-er" /> to put your cubies in the correct location is that each move affects precisely three cubies.
					All others are left unmoved. 
					By using just <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> and <xref ref="cube-move-er" />, we can thus put each cubie in the correct location.
					However, even if a cubie is in the correct location, it may be that its stickers are on the wrong faces<mdash />in this case, it needs to be <em>reoriented</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this section, we will see how to reorient cubies once they are in the correct location.
					To do so, we'll learn two moves: one that reorients corners, and one that reorients edges.
					Once we are able to put each cubie in the correct location, and then orient it correctly, each scrambled Cube becomes a puzzle, solvable by clever application of these moves.

			<title>Conclusion</title>
				<p>
					In this section, we explored the last moves we need to solve the Cube. 
					We also described a strategy for solving the Cube. 
					Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn.
					The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are advantages and disadvantages to all solution methods.
					Advantages to corners-first are:
					<ul>
						<li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
						<li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
						<li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
						<li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>

			<title>Truth</title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					As Su identifies in <xref ref="Su2020" />, humans have an innate desire for truth.
					Defining just what we mean by <term>truth</term> is tricky, so we'll follow Su's lead and just say that <q>true statements are ones that align with reality</q>.
					In an age of rampant disinformation, we seek to know what is actually true.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth.
					One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. 
					Yet, mathematics is a human endeavor; and what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being <q>true</q>, anyway? 
					The answer might surprise you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this unit, we'll explore inductive and deductive reasoning, as well as formal logic. 
					We'll explore the shortcomings of mathematical thinking in addition to its strengths.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This chapter is heavily influenced by <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/truth-reasoning-certainty-and-proof">Discovering the Art of Mathematics: Truth, Reasoning, Certainty, and Proof</url></em> by Fleron, Hotchkiss, Ecke, and von Renesse.

								<em>Truth</em> refers to propositions which are correct and valid for all time, places, and people. It never changes. <em>Facts</em> refer to propositions supported by evidence. They are subject to change based on new evidence.

								Muslims do not.

					<p>
						The work of the guesser in <xref ref="act-whats-my-world" /> is to employ inductive reasoning to determine the general law put in place by the creator.

						<statement>
							<p>
								Let's play a game with dots and lines. 
								We'll start with at least two dots (though you'll probably want to increase this number pretty quickly).
								The rules are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Split your dots into two groups, group <m>A</m> and group <m>B</m>, and draw each group on its own line.</li>
								<li>Connect (some of) the dots from <m>A</m> to (some of) the dots in <m>B</m> with lines. The lines don't have to be straight<mdash />they can curve in any way you want!<mdash />but each line should connect precisely two dots: one from <m>A</m> and one from <m>B</m>.</li>
								<li>Each dot should be connected to at least one other dot<mdash />no lonely dots!</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								So, if I label four dots as <m>X, Y, Z, W</m>, <em>one possible</em> drawing is given in <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" />.
							</p>
							<figure xml:id="fig-dot-game-example">

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The lines can be drawn so that none of them cross.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Now consider the following questions.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Redraw the picture in <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" /> so that none of the lines cross.</li>
								<li>Give a name to drawings of figures like <xref ref="fig-dot-game-example" /> which <em>can</em> be drawn so that none of the lines cross.</li>
								<li>Which drawings are possible with two or three dots? Can they be drawn to have the property that none of the lines cross?</li>
								<li>What other drawings are possible with four dots? Five?</li>
								<li>Based on your work here, do you think it will always be possible to draw these pictures so that none of the lines cross? Explain your thinking.</li>

						Formal mathematical reasoning is deductive (defined momentarily), and begins with <term>axioms</term>, which are statements that should be self-evident and taken to be true.
						Note that while axioms are not always explicitly stated, they <em>can</em> be when necessary.
					</p>
					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
						<p>
							The most famous set of axioms are Euclid's postulates for geometry, defined in <em><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements">The Elements</url></em>, which not only shaped thousands of years of geometry, but solidified the deductive approach to doing and explaining mathematics that we will explore in this unit.
							At the beginning of Book I of <em>The Elements</em>, Euclid identified five postulates and five axioms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Euclid's <em>postulates</em> are:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</li>
							<li>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</li>

								They should be as simple as possible; all except Euclid's fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) are considered quite straightforward.
								The parallel postulate has a fascinating history; it turns out be independent of the other postulates, and one can create new geometries (on the surface of a sphere, for instance), by rejecting it.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are lots of unproved assumptions that we make in life.
								Many Christian mathematicians make explicit that they view the authority of Scripture as an axiom; they can't use logic to conclusively deduce that Scripture is the only authority for Christian faith and life, but they <em>assume</em> it in order to draw conclusions <em>about</em> faith and life.

						The process of <term>deductive reasoning</term> in mathematics begins from a set of generally agreed-upon axioms of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory">set theory</url><fn>It should be noted that there is disagreement about the Axiom of Choice, mostly due to some of its surprising consequences.</fn> and uses logic to make inevitable conclusions from those axioms. These conclusions are generally called <term>theorems</term>. They are usually given as conditional statements of the form <q>If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>,</q> where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are sensible<aside>For some definition of the word <q>sensible</q>.</aside> statements.
						Moreover, since most deductive statements are presented in conditional form, their scope is generally limited.
						That is, the statement <q>if it is Monday, then we have math class</q> is only making a claim about what happens on Mondays; it says nothing whatsoever about any other day of the week.

						The author Lewis Carroll loved logic puzzles (he was actually a mathematics professor!), and wrote many of them. Here is one, axiomatized for easy reference.
					</p>
	
					
					<axiom xml:id="axiom-kittens">
						<title>(Carroll)</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Consider the axioms:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>If a kitten loves fish, then it is teachable.</li>
								<li>Every kitten without a tail will play with a gorilla.</li>
								<li>All kittens with whiskers love fish.</li>
								<li>If a kitten has green eyes, then it is not teachable.</li>
								<li>All kittens have whiskers or do not have tails.</li>
							</ol>
							
						</statement>
					</axiom>
					
					<p>
						Once you have a deductive argument that (generally) begins from your premises and reasons, step-by-step, to your conclusion, you can write out the argument in a short essay known as a <em>proof</em>.
						For our purposes, a proof is just a <em>convicing argument</em>.
						It should be written at a level appropriate to the reader and clearly lay out the steps necessary for a reader who accepts your hypotheses to believe the conclusion.
						As an example, consider the following.
					</p>
					
					<example xml:id="example-kitten-deduction">
						<statement>
							<p>
								All kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
							<p>
								<term>Proof</term>. Suppose we have a kitten with whiskers. Let's call him Arthur. By <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #3, Arthur loves fish. Since Arthur loves fish, <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #1 implies that Arthur is teachable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since Arthur was an arbitrary kitten, we conclude that all kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</example>
					
					<p>
						There are several observations which are worth a moment of our time in the proof in <xref ref="example-kitten-deduction" />.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We first note that the proof is written using standard conventions of academic writing, including complete sentences, proper punctuation and capitalization, etc. This is important! In order to convince someone that your argument is valid, they need to be able to read it.</li>
						<li>While the statement to be proved is not written as <q>if <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m></q>, it <em>can</em> be stated that way: <q>If <m>A</m> is a kitten with whiskers, then <m>A</m> is teachable</q>. Thus, our proof begins by considering an arbitrary kitten with whiskers, who we name Arthur. We observe, however, that there is nothing special about Arthur that figures into our proof in a meaningful way, so the argument will apply just as well to any kitten with whiskers we may find.</li>
						<li>In each step we take throughout the proof, we refer to the specific axiom from <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> that allow us to take that step. It is valuable to be able to do this, but generally we do not specifically refer to the axioms by number. This is to improve the readability of the proof.</li>
						<li>Finally, note that our proof concludes with a conclusion: all kittens with whiskers are teachable. This is good practice and sends an unmistakable signal to the reader that you are done.</li>
					</ul>

						Now, prove the theorems that follow using <xref ref="axiom-kittens" />.

						<title>Conclusion</title>
						<p>
							In this section, we explored deductive reasoning, which begins from accepted axioms and premises and then reasons, step by logical step, toward a conclusion.
							This is the primary form of reasoning used in mathematics.
							We saw that while conclusions reached via deductive reasoning are generally tighter and more certain, there are still some drawbacks.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main drawback of deductive reasoning involves scope.
							We must begin with axioms, so the axioms must be well-chosen and sensible.
							However, if one disagrees with the choice of a set of axioms, then one must be willing to set aside any results deduced from them (or, at least, deduced from the particular axioms with which one disagrees).
						</p>
						<p>
							A second drawback having to do with scope concerns the premises of a conditional statement.
							In particular, if the premises of a statement are not satisfied, the statement makes no assertion whatsoever 
							(though, as we will see in <xref ref="chap-logic" />, there is still a <em>consistent</em> way to assign truth values to statements whose premises are not satisfied).

				<title>Modern Mathematical Logic</title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						In <xref ref="chap-reasoning" />, we explored two types of reasoning: inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning.
						The type of reasoning used most often in mathematics is deductive reasoning.
						In the late 19th/early 20th century, logic itself was mathematized by the likes of George Boole and Augustus De Morgan into a <em>propositional calculus</em>.
						This gave mathematicians a means of determining the truth value of a statement purely based on its inherent logical structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is this method of calculating that we explore in this chapter.
					</p>

						<title>Motivating Questions</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								In this section, we will explore the following questions.
								<ol>
									<li>What is a proposition?</li>
									<li>What are logical connectives? How can they be used to build new propositions?</li>
									<li>What does it mean for two propositions to be logically equivalent?</li>	  
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</p>
					</assemblage>
					
					
					
					<p>
						In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematicians began mathematize and formalize logic itself. Today we begin to explore these foundational issues. We'll start with some definitions.
					</p>
		
					
					<definition>
						<index>proposition</index>
						<index><h>proposition</h><h>elementary</h></index>
						<index>logical connectives</index>
						<p>
							A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence which is either true or false, but not both.
							An <term>elementary proposition</term> is a sentence with a subject and a verb, but no connectives (such as <em>and, or, not, if-then,</em> or <em>if-and-only-if</em>).
						</p>
		
					</definition>
					
					<activity xml:id="act-propositions">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Determine which of the following are propositions (elementary or otherwise).
								If a given sentence is a proposition, determine its truth value.
								If it isn't, explain why not.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Erik Hoekstra is the president of Dordt University.</li>
								<li>The square root of a whole number is always a whole number.</li>
								<li>The Green Bay Packers are the worst football team.</li>
								<li>Why is this class so much fun?</li>
								<li>This sentence is false.</li>
								<li>A group of crows is called a murder.</li>
								<li>Everyone likes cats.</li>
							</ol>
		
						</statement>
						
						<solution>
							<ol>
								<li>This is a true proposition.</li>
								<li>This is a false proposition. As an example, <m>\sqrt{21}</m> is not a whole number.</li>
								<li>This one is harder (though it's an easy "true" from your instructor). But it's likely either a false proposition (due to the Packers not having the worst record in the league) or not a proposition at all, as agreement with the sentence is a matter of subjective taste.</li>
								<li>This is an interrogative, not a declaration.</li>
								<li>This is a declarative sentence, but it's neither true nor false; it's a paradox.</li>
								<li>This is a true proposition! Who knew?</li>
								<li>This is a false proposition.</li>
							</ol>
		
						</solution>
		
		
					</activity>
					
					<p>
						Now that we have a sense for what a proposition is, we'll take old propositions and make new ones using <em>logical connectives</em>.
						In order to describe how the connectives work, mathematicians define the truth values of the new propositions <em>formally</em><mdash />that is, without regard to the content of the propositions themselves<mdash />in terms of the possible combinations of truth values from the constituent propositions.
						This gives us an abstract way of considering the truth values of propositions.

									<li>What are formal systems?</li>
									<li>What was Hilbert's goal? How was it resolved?</li>
									<li>How did Cantor describe infinite sets?</li>

						<title>Formal Systems</title>
					
						<p>
							We have seen thus far a way of formalizing logic so that we can think about the truth of a statement purely syntactically (structurally) without regard for the semantic meaning of the statements under consideration.
							In the late 19th century, mathematicians developed what became known as <term>formal systems</term>, consisting of axioms, which were strings of symbols, such as
							<me>
								\exists B \forall C, (C\in B \Leftrightarrow C\subseteq A),
							</me>
							along with a <term>logical calculus</term>, which govern the rules of inference that can be used on the axioms to deduce new theorems.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Further, mathematicians had long assumed there were consistent foundational axioms for their discipline.
							Newly discovered paradoxes challenged this view.
						</p>
						<exploration>
							<title>Russell's Paradox</title>
							<p>
								In a certain town lives a barber who only cuts the hair of <em>all</em> people who do not cut their own hair.
								Who cuts the barber's hair?
							</p>
	<!-- 						<solution>
								<p>
									This is a paradox: if the barber cuts his own hair, we reach a contradiction, as he only cuts the hair of those who do not cut their own hair. On the other hand, if the barber does not cut his own hair, he does by definition.
								</p>
								<p>
									This sort of self-referential paradox is exactly the sort that we'll study later in this section that led to the foundational crisis referred to in the section title.
								</p>
							</solution> -->
						</exploration>
						
						<p>
							Two main schools of mathematical philosophy sprung up in the wake of these discoveries.
							The <term>formalists</term> argued that statements of mathematics and logic are really just about the rules and consequences for manipulating symbols and strings of letters.
							That is, mathematics does not have a subject matter at all--just empty symbols, which may be given an interpretation in particular situations and thus have meaning.
						</p>
						<p>
							The response came from the <term>intuitionists</term>.
							Intuitionism is an approach that considers mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of any principles which we can reasonably claim exist in an objective reality.
							Thus, in some sense, mathematics is up to whoever is doing the mathematics.
							To the intuitionists, the formalists were reducing mathematics to a meaningless game with symbols.
						</p>
						
						<principle>
							<p>
								Do you resonate more with a formalist approach to mathematics, or an intuitionist approach?
								Relatedly: do you believe mathematics is something humans invent, or something we discover in the world around us?
								Why?
							</p>
						</principle>
		
		
						<p>
							In 1900, at the second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert posed 23 theretofore unanswered problems in mathematics that he thought were important to guide the development of mathematics in the 20th century.
							We've already seen one of them (the 8th): the Goldbach conjecture.
							Most of Hilbert's problems have been solved, but three are unresolved, two are thought to be too vague to ever get consensus on what a solution would look like, and one is the subject of much debate.
						</p>
						<p>					
							In an attempt to resolve the issues raised by paradoxes like Russell's Paradox, Hilbert posed this problem, the second on the list:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results….
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>
							That is, Hilbert wanted mathematicians to prove that the axioms on which mathematics was founded did not lead to a contradiction.
							The resolution to this problem is surprising, and to begin to explore it, we will turn to the infinite.

						<title>Infinity and Incompleteness</title>
						
							<p>
								In <xref ref="subsec-formal-systems" />, we learned about the push from mathematicians in the late 19th/early 20th century were trying to show that the axioms, the very foundations on which mathematics was built, were both <em>complete</em> (the truth of every sensible statement could be decided via deductions from the axioms) and <em>consistent</em> (one could never deduce contradictory statements from the axioms).
							</p>
							
							<p>
								For reasons which are hopefully clear, we'll assume that the axioms are consistent, that is, no contradictions will arise from them. (If contradictions <em>can</em> arise, we are in trouble indeed.)
								But if the axioms are consistent, can it be shown that they're complete?
								To answer this question, we dive into the realm of infinity.

								<index>incompleteness theorems</index>
								In the early 1930s, the Austrian mathematical logician Kurt Godel revolutionized mathematical logic with his two <term>incompleteness theorems</term>.
								Informally, first incompleteness theorem states that any sufficiently strong, consistent formal system contains undecidable statements.
								That is, there are sensible statements, such as the one raised in <xref ref="disc-ch" />, which cannot be proved from within the system.
								In that case, we may choose to adopt either the statement <em>or its negation</em> as an additional axiom, and may do so without creating any contradiction.
							</p>
							<p>
								The question in <xref ref="disc-ch" /> leads to just such a proposition, namely that no such set <m>S</m> exists.
								This has been known as the <term>continuum hypothesis</term>.
								It was first suggested by Cantor in 1878, and was one of Hilbert's 23 problems.
								Godel himself proved in 1940 that its negation, i.e., that such a set <m>S</m> does exist, is independent of the usual axioms of set theory.
								The mathematician Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that the continuum hypothesis itself is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, thus verifying that the hypothesis is undecidable.

			<introduction>
			
				<p>
					In the <xref ref="Sec-Introduction">Introduction</xref> to this book, we cited Francis Su's retiring MAA presidential address, <em>Mathematics for Human Flourishing</em>.
					In his address, Su argues that the practice of mathematics can cultivate virtues that help humans live lives of fullness and flourishing.
					We've explored the ways in which mathematics enables us to play and discern truth.
					We will next explore the ways in which the <em>power</em> of mathematics can be brought to bear to help us understand phenomena such as the current (as of this writing) coronavirus pandemic.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As Su writes in his follow-up book <xref ref="Su2020" />, <em>power</em> "often sounds like a bad word," especially when applied to humans.
					Yet Su means power in the sense in which Andy Crouch defines it in his book, <url href="https://www.ivpress.com/playing-god"><em>Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power</em></url>:
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					Power is the ability to make something of the world...the ability to participate in that stuff-making, sense-making process that is the most distinctive thing that human beings do.
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					In this unit, we will focus particularly on the <em>sense-making</em> component of power and ask: how do mathematical explorers make sense of the physical world via mathematics?
					We will explore some increasingly advanced discrete mathematical models, with the ultimate goal of understanding a basic model of how infectious disease spreads through a population.
					Let's get started.

						<title>Motivating Questions</title>
						<p>
							<statement>
								In this section, we will explore the following questions.
								<ol>
									<li>What is a sequence?</li>
									<li>How can we use discrete sequences to describe real-world phenomena?</li>
									<li>What is the difference between a recursive definition and an explicit formula for a discrete sequence?</li>	  
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</p>
					</assemblage>
					
					
					<p>
						We begin our study with an exploration of <em>sequences</em>.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-sequence">
						<index>sequence</index>
						<index><h>sequence</h><h>terms of</h></index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A <term>sequence</term> is an ordered list of numbers, called <term>terms</term>.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					
					<p>
						That's it!
						Typically, we explore sequences which continue forever; these are generally called <term>infinite sequences</term>.
						Such sequences are typically described using a mathematical rule of some sort.
						Let's look at an example.
					</p>
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					<example xml:id="example-recursive">
					
						<p>
						
							Joris is a collector of board games.
							His collection currently has 37 games, and each year he budgets enough to acquire 8 new games.
							We'll use the notation <m>G_t</m> to describe how many games Joris has in year <m>t</m>, where we consider <m>G_0</m> (that is, in year <m>t=0</m>) to be the number of games he currently has.
							Thus, <m>G_0 = 37</m>.
							We would also expect <m>G_1 = 37 + 8 = 45</m>, and <m>G_2 = 45 + 8 = 53</m>.
							We say that <m>37, 45, 53\ldots</m> are the first three <term>terms</term> of the sequence.
						</p>
						<p>
							This way of describing the number of games Joris has is known as a <term>recursive</term> description, where each term depends on previous terms.
							That is, the recursive description is given by the formula
								<men xml:id="eq-recursive-games">
									G_0 = 37, \ G_{t+1} = G_t + 8, t \ge 1.
								</men>
						</p>
						
					
					</example>
					
					<p>
						Since the sequence above only allows for whole number inputs, it cannot estimate the number of board games Joris will have in 1.3 years, or <m>\pi/4</m> years; the system's prediction changes by 8 as the elapsed time changes from 1 to 2, 5 to 6, and so on.
						This makes the sequence <term>discrete</term>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also note the recursive nature of the definition of the sequence in <xref ref="example-recursive" />.
						But there are other ways to describe sequences, and we turn to those now.
					</p>
					
					<activity xml:id="act-games">
						<statement>
							<p>
							A recursive definition is nice because it is reasonably intuitive and fits with our usual understanding of how things change over time: they start from where they are now, and then change a little every so often.
							But perhaps we'd like to know how long it will take Joris to accumulate 500 games. 
<!-- 							<aside><url href="https://omahamagazine.com/articles/game-on/">People do this</url>, I swear.</aside> -->
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Clearly describe in 2-3 sentences <em>a process</em> for using the recursive definition in <xref ref="example-recursive" /> that would allow you to determine how many years it would take Joris to accumulate 500 board games. Please do not use this process to answer the question!</li>
								<li>In 2-3 sentences, describe the disadvantage in the process you used in Question 1 for finding how long it would take Joris to accumulate 500 games.</li>
								<li>What we want is a <term>explicit formula</term> for <m>G_t</m>. That is, we want a formula that allows us to plug in a value for <m>t</m> that will give us the number of games <m>G_t</m> that Joris has in year <m>t</m> without having to know any of the previous terms in the sequence. Find such a formula, and compute the first three terms to convince your group that your formula produces the same sequence as <xref ref="eq-recursive-games" />.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<ol>
								<li>Just using the recursive formula provided in <xerf ref="eq-recursive-games" />, we could find the number of years it would take Joris to accumulate 500 board games by generating the terms of the sequence and seeing when it passes 500. We would do this by first finding <m>G_1</m>, then <m>G_1</m> to find <m>G_2</m>, then using <m>G_2</m> to find <m>G_3</m>, etc.</li>
								<li>This is highly inefficient! In order to know, e.g., <m>G_{500}</m>, you would need to compute <em>all</em> preceding terms.</li>
								<li>An explicit formula is given by <m>G_t = 37 + 8t</m>. Observe that <m>G_1 = 37 + 8\cdot 1 = 45</m>, <m>G_2 = 37 + 8\cdot 2 = 37 + 16 = 53</m>, and <m>G_3 = 38 + 8\cdot 3 = 61</m>.</li>

						The sequence described in <xref ref="act-games" /> is known as a <term>linear</term> sequence.
						This is because, like a line, it grows at a constant rate.
						Linear growth is extremely useful because it is straightforward to understand and apply.

							In this section, we explored the idea of a (discrete) sequence.
							A sequence is just a list of numbers, and we considered sequences which are (in theory, at least) infinite.
							We saw two ways of describing a sequence other than just listing the numbers in order: recursively, and with an explicit formula.
							The recursive definition fits with our intuition about how quantities change over time, but it can be tedious to calculate terms that appear late in the sequence, as you need to calculate every term leading up to the one in which you're interested.
							Explicit formulas, on the other hand, give us shortcuts to calculating any term we want, but can often be hard to find and can obscure the actual behavior of the sequence.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next time, we'll take a look at the ways in which we can combine multiple sequences to create <em>systems</em>.
							These systems can be used to describe the behavior of real-world interactions.
							In particular, we'll explore a basic predator-prey model (involving two populations, the predators and the prey), and then a system of three sequences that describes the basic dynamics of the spread of a disease.

								 <ol>
									 <li>What is a discrete dynamical system? How do they relate to sequences?</li>
									 <li>How can we use discrete dynamical systems to describe real-world phenomena like predator-prey interactions, or the spread of a disease in a population?</li>

					<introduction>
						<p>
							In <xref ref="sec-intro-to-dds" />, we introduced the notion of a sequence.
							In this section, we will focus on situations in which our sequences represent a quantity changing over discrete, consistent periods of time.
							We will also consider <em>systems</em> of sequences: two or more interrelated sequences which describe the behavior of multiple changing quantities all at once.
							Before we dive into such systems, we consider another type of growth.

						<title>Exponential Growth</title>
						
						<p>
							Populations of people and animals do not grow linearly. Instead, they usually grow by a percentage of the whatever the current population is.
							So, if that percentage is, say, 10%, and the current population of a group of fish in a pond is 1000, this model predicts a population of <m>1000 + 10\%\cdot 1000 = 1000 + 100 = 1100</m> fish for next year.
						</p>
						<p>
							In symbols, if <m>P_t</m> represents the number of fish <m>t</m> years from now, then <m>P_0 = 1000</m>, <m>P_1 = P_0 + 0.1\cdot P_0 = (1+0.1)P_0 = 1.1 P_0</m>.
							The number 0.1 is called the <term>growth rate</term>, <m>r</m>, and the number 1.1 is the <term>growth multiplier</term>.

										<title>A discrete predator-prey model</title>
										
									<p>
										We now consider systems of discrete sequences, called <term>discrete dynamical systems</term>.
									</p>									
										
									<definition xml:id="def-dynamical-system">
										<p>
											A <term>dynamical system</term> refers to any fixed mathematical rule which describes how a system changes over time.
											A <term>discrete</term> dynamical system changes at fixed intervals in time (e.g., each hour), and does not change between the fixed points in time (e.g., a system that changes each hour will view the changing quantity as static between the hours of 1:00pm and 2:00pm).
										</p>
									
									</definition>
									
									
									
									<p>
										There are two main types of dynamical systems: discrete and continuous.
										The study of continuous dynamical systems is the domain of calculus and its related disciplines (e.g., differential equations).
										Continuous dynamical systems treat time as infinitely divisible; discrete dynamical systems do not.
										Typically, a dynamical <em>system</em> involves multiple related quantities that change over time.
									</p> 
									
									<p>
										We begin with a classic predator-prey model adapted from the <url href="https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/amwiki/index.php/Predator_prey">Feedback Systems Wiki</url> at Caltech.
										For historical reasons, we let <m>L_t</m> be the size of a population of Canadian lynxes in year <m>t</m> and <m>H_t</m> be the size of a population of snowshoe hares, the lynx's primary prey. <aside>Of course, we can carry out the following analysis using any predator/prey pair.</aside>
									</p>
									
									<definition xml:id="def-lotkavolterra">
										<p>
											Let <m>H_0</m> be the initial population of hares, and <m>L_0</m> the initial population of lynxes.
											For <m>t\ge 1</m>, the <term>discrete Lotka-Volterra model</term> for the lynx/hare population is given by:
										</p>
										<md>
											<mrow>H_{t+1} \amp = H_t + b(u) H_t - a L_t H_t</mrow>
											<mrow>L_{t+1} \amp = L_t + c L_t H_t - d L_t,</mrow>
										</md>
										<p>
											where <m>b</m> is the hare birth rate per unit time as a function of the food supply <m>u</m>, <m>d</m> is the lynx mortality rate, and <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> are interaction coefficients.
										</p>
									</definition>
									
									
					
									
									<p>
										Note the interrelationship between the two equations: the formula for calculating <m>H_{t+1}</m> requires knowing not only <m>H_t</m>, but also <m>L_t</m>.
										This makes sense!
										These populations interact, so the presence (or absence) of lynx should reasonably affect the hare population.
										Let's further analyze this model.

									To be clear, the purpose of the model is not to make absolutely certain predictions about the precise numbers of hares and lynxes present in the Canadian wilderness.
									Instead, we want to understand the broad dynamics of how the populations change relative to one another.
									Mathematical ecologists can then use these models to understand how small changes in the parameters (say, an increase in the rate of predation) affect the broader dynamics of the ecological system.

							<title>The discrete SIR epidemiological model</title>
							
							<p>
								We now arrive at the main focus of this two-week unit: a basic mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease.
								We'll first present the model itself and examine its features and assumptions.
								As was the case with the predator-prey model, we'll see that while it does make simplifying assumptions, it still allows us to analyze the broader dynamics of the disease transmission.
								We'll then look at ways of reducing the rate of infection, including the so-called "flattening the curve" method.
							</p>
							<p>
								We begin with the model.
								It is known as a <em>compartmental model</em>, as it divides the population into compartments and assumes that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics (at least as far as the transmission of the disease is concerned).
								We'll look at the simplest such model, the discrete SIR model.
								Many more complex models are built on the SIR model.
							</p>
						
							
							<definition>
								<p>
									Consider a population of <m>N</m> people through which a disease is spreading.
									For some discrete time <m>t \ge 0</m>, let <m>S_t</m> denote the number of individuals <em>susceptible</em> to the disease, <m>I_t</m> the number of individuals <em>infected</em> with the disease, and <m>R_t</m> the number of individuals who have <em>recovered</em> from the disease.
									We assume that that people move through the compartments as follows:
								</p>
								
									<men xml:id="eq-compartments">
										S \to I \to R.
									</men>
								
								<p>
						
									For <m>t\ge 1</m>, the model is given by the following equations.
								</p>
								<md>
									<mrow>N \amp = S_t + I_t + R_t</mrow>
									<mrow>S_{t+1} \amp = S_t -b S_t I_t</mrow>
									<mrow>I_{t+1} \amp = I_t + b S_t I_t - a I_t</mrow>
									<mrow>R_{t+1} \amp = R_t + a I_t.</mrow>
								</md>
								<p>
									The constant <m>a</m> is known as the <em>recovery rate</em> parameter, which roughly describes how fast someone moves from the infected compartment to the recovered compartment. The constant <m>b</m> is known as the <em>infection rate</em>, and roughly describes how fast someone moves from the susceptible compartment to the infected compartment.

								For our last activity, we'll explore how reducing <m>r_0</m> "flattens" the curve of infected people at time <m>t</m>, <m>I_t</m>.

						This topic comes to us from the realm of mathematics known as <em>number theory</em>, which is all about the properties of the integers: positive whole numbers, negatives of whole numbers, and zero.
						Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics; some of its hallmark theorems, still vital and taught today, have been known for thousands of years.
						And many of the deep structural features of the integers have found modern application in the hiding and transmitting of information.
						It is toward this last application that we now turn.

						 <p>
							 <statement>
								 In this section, we will explore the following questions.
								 <ol>
									<li>How can modular arithmetic be applied to the transmission of information?</li>
									<li>How does the UPC check digit scheme work? What errors can it detect? What errors can it correct?</li>										  
								 </ol>

					 </assemblage>
					 
					<p>
						In <xref ref="sec-intro-to-mod-arithmetic" />, we learned about modular arithmetic, which works by considering the remainders obtained upon division by a fixed number <m>m</m>.
						In this section, we'll consider a relatively recent application of modular arithmetic to <term>coding theory</term>, which is the mathematical study of transmitting information.
					</p>
					<p>
						The basic problem of coding theory is as follows: in order to send information from one entity to another, it needs to be encoded in some form by the <em>sender</em> (e.g., written, recorded, etc) and transmitted across a <em>channel</em> (e.g., mailed, emailed, uploaded/downloaded, etc) to the <em>receiver</em>.
						However, errors can creep into the process<mdash />written messages can be smudged, physical defects or packet loss can corrupt digital messages, and so on, resulting in information that either cannot be read at all, or can be misread.						
						How can we be reasonably sure that common errors can be detected, and, if possible, corrected?
					</p>
					
					<activity xml:id="warmup-coding">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Alice wants to send a bit of information to her friend Bob; for simplicity's sake, let's assume she seeks to send a 0 or 1.
								To ensure that the digit is received correctly, she decides to send it three times in a row.
								Bob will then read the intended digit as the digit that appears most often.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>How would Bob interpret Alice's message if he received <m>111</m>? What if he received <m>010</m>?</li>
								<li>What strengths and weaknesses do you see in Alice's system? How could you improve upon it?</li>
								<li>Perhaps you decided that Alice's system isn't sure enough, so you decide she should send the digit seven times. In what way(s) is this revised system better? Worse?</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</activity>
						
					<p>
						Lots of information is encoded using numbers, which makes the reliable transmission of numbers an important problem to solve.
						A fundamental example is alluded to in <xref ref="warmup-coding" />, wherein we consider the transmission of a binary digit, 0 or 1<mdash />this is the language of digital computers.
						The actual codes that are used to transmit digital signals over the internet rely on lots of sophisticated mathematics and so are beyond the scope of our work here.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, certain codes are within the grasp of those familiar with modular arithmetic.
						We turn to one such example now: the UPC check digit scheme.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Universal Product Codes (UPCs) are found on most items available for sale (though books have their own identifiers called International Standard Book Numbers, or ISBNs)<footnote>UPCs are often encoded with <em>barcodes</em> so as to be machine-readable. We will concern ourselves only with the digits, not the barcodes</footnote>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's consider the UPC from a copy of the game <q>The Resistance</q>:
					</p>
					<me>
						7-22301-92617-8.
					</me>
					<p>
						The first digit (7) indicates a product type.
						This is typically 0, 1, or 6-9 (other digits are reserved for coupons, loyalty cards, etc).
						The first group of five digits (22301) is a manufacturer number, while the second group of five digits (92617) describes the product.
						The last digit (8) is known as the <term>check digit</term>; it is chosen so that
					</p>
					<me>
						(3\cdot 7 + 2 + 3\cdot 2 + 3 + 3\cdot 0 + 1 + 3\cdot 9 + 2 + 3\cdot 6 + 1 + 3\cdot 7 + 8)\equiv 0\mod 10.
					</me>
					
					<p>
						More generally, if the digits of a UPC are <m>d_1 - d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 - d_7 d_8 d_9 d_{10} d_{11} - d_{12}</m>, the check digit <m>d_{12}</m> is chosen so that
					</p>
					<me>
						(3\cdot d_1 + d_2 + 3\cdot d_3 + d_4 + 3\cdot d_5 + d_6 + 3\cdot d_7 + d_8 + 3\cdot d_9 + d_{10} + 3\cdot d_{11} + d_{12})\equiv 0\mod 10.
					</me>
					
					<p>
						The check digit is called thus as it is an extra bit of information which helps validate everything that came before it.
						Recall that our primary question is: how can we send information reliably over a channel?
						That is, how can we send information in such a way that we can (a) if the information received is the same as what we sent, and (b) if not, (ideally) correct the information?						
					</p>

					One of the goals of this text is to expand the domain of mathematical questions to new areas.
					While we need to be careful to not overreach, mathematical ways of knowing have recently illuminated many interesting questions, and occasionally answered them.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example of this involves recent mathematical explorations of democracy.
					In <xref ref="chap-voting" />, we will consider mathematical analyses of various methods of choosing winner(s) of elections and discuss the question: is there a single best, fairest system?
					In <xref ref="chap-apportionment" />, we will explore the systems of assigning representatives to geographical areas that have been employed throughout U.S. history.
					And in <xref ref="chap-redistricting" />, we'll explore the process of drawing new districts based on shifting populations to ensure that those geographical areas are represented fairly.
				</p>
				<p>
					As we will see, mathematics helps us explore these questions, but it cannot provide perfect answers, as human desires<mdash />for justice, fairness, and equity<mdash /> are not mathematical constructs.

							The two-candidate voting system we haven't yet explored is probably the one that you actually suggested in <xref ref="act-voting-intro" />.
							Perhaps it is something like:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							Each voter should vote for the candidate they want to win the election.
							The votes are counted, and the candidate with the largest number of votes should be declared the winner.<aside>We'll worry about ties separately.</aside>
						</blockquote>
						<p>

						<investigation>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Which of the three fairness criteria does majority rule satisfy? Give a clear and convincing explanation of your answers.
								</p>
							</statement>
							<solution>
								<p>
									All of them! It behaves much the same way as minority rule, except now it's helpful to get more votes.
								</p>
						
							</solution>
						
						</investigation>
						
						<p>
							In fact, for elections with two candidates, majority rule is the only system to satisfy all three fairness criteria.
						</p>
						
						<theorem xml:id="thm-may">
							<creator>K. May (1952)</creator>
							<statement>
								<p>
									In a two-candidate election with an odd number of voters, majority rule is the only voting system that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone and avoids the possibility of a tie.
								</p>
							</statement>
						</theorem>
						
						<conclusion>
							<p>
								Thus, for elections with two candidates, there is a clear just choice for a voting system subject to our adopted fairness criteria: majority rule.
								However, as we know, most elections don't have just two candidates, so we will next consider how to handle situations with more than two choices.
								We'll refine the existing fairness criteria to handle three or more candidates, and develop additional criteria due to surprising situations that can arise.

						<index>spoiler candidate</index>
						In fact, many political scientists believe that Ralph Nader was a <em>spoiler candidate</em> for Gore in 2000; that is, they believe that a large percentage of the Nader voters likely would have voted for Gore if Nader had not been on the ballot.
						Moreover, since Florida was the deciding factor in the election (we'll talk more about the electoral college later), the razor-thin margin of 537 votes (0.009% of the popular vote in Florida) swung the election from Gore to Bush.
						In this section, we'll explore the wrinkles introduced by additional candidates, and develop alternative systems for choosing winners of elections.

					</p>
					
					<exploration xml:id="expl-GOPprimary">
						<index>societal preference order</index>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Twenty-one people filed paperwork with the U.S. Federal Election Commission as candidates for the 2016 Republication nomination for president.
								There were 31,183,841 votes cast in the Republican primaries nationwide in 2016.

					<subsection>
						<title>A solution</title>
						
						<p>
							As we saw in <xref ref="expl-GOPprimary" />, when there are <m>N</m> candidates, it is possible for the vote to be split so thoroughly that one candidate can win with just over <m>1/N</m>-th of the vote.
							In this case, a majority of the voters will prefer someone other than the person who is ultimately elected.
							But the situation is even worse than that<mdash/>it's possible for the candidate who wins the plurality of the vote to be the <em>last</em> choice of a <em>majority</em> of voters, but still win!
							The main reason that the plurality method is susceptible to this is that it only takes a voter's first choice into account; there is no penalty for being a voter's last choice, and no benefit to being the voter's second choice.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<index>preference order</index>
							We will therefore explore methods of voting and fairness criteria that account for a full top-to-bottom ranking of candidates by voters, called a <term>preference order</term>.
							If there are three candidates in an election, say Michael, Lindsay, and Buster, and my preference order is that Michael is my top candidate, Buster my second choice, and Lindsay my third, we may write <m>M \succ B \succ L</m>, where the symbol <m>\succ</m> means "is preferred to".

						<title>The Borda Count</title>

								One very popular method for choosing the winner of a multi-candidate election is the Borda count.
							</p>
							
							<definition>
								<index>Borda count</index>
								<index><h>voting system</h><h>Borda count</h></index>
								<p>
									Consider an election with <m>N</m> candidates.
									The <term>Borda count</term> works as follows.
									Each voter submits a ballot that contains their entire preference order for all candidates in the election.
									For each ballot cast, points are awarded to each candidate according to the following rules:
								</p>
								<ul>										
									<li>A last-place vote is worth 1 point.</li>
									<li>A second-to-last-place vote is worth 2 points.</li>
									<li><m>\vdots</m></li>
									<li>A third-place vote is worth <m>N-2</m> points.</li>
									<li>A second-place vote is worth <m>N-1</m> points.</li>
									<li>A first-place vote is worth <m>N</m> points.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>
									The candidate who accumulates the largest number of total points from all of the ballots is declared the winner, and the societal preference order is determined by listing the candidates in order of the number of points they received, largest to smallest.
									In the event that two or more candidates are tied with the largest number of points, they are all declared winners (or some suitable prearranged tiebreaking procedure is used).

						<conclusion>
							<p>
								In this section, we have seen that things become more complicated when we consider more than two candidates.
								In an election with only two candidates, a vote for one implicitly ranks the other candidate second.
								With more than two candidates, not only can societal preferences be more diffuse, but they are also more complex than can be captured with simple plurality voting.
								It is possible for a candidate who is the least desirable choice of an <em>overwhelming majority</em> of the voters to win if there are enough other candidates.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the next section, we will explore additional voting systems and fairness criteria that attempt to overcome the shortcomings of the Borda count.

						In <xref ref="act-10klakes" />, we saw that the plurality method can fail to elect a candidate who would win a head-to-head matchup against all other candidates.

						In order to find a voting system that satisfies the CWC and CLC, let's return to the Bluth Company presidential election in <xref ref="expl-bcprez" />.
					</p>
					
					<exploration xml:id="expl-spv">
						<statement>
							<p>
								Consider the following proposed voting system, using <xref ref="table-bcprez" /> as the preference schedule.
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Step 1: First, we'll ask voters to choose between George and Lindsay. Since this is a two-candidate election, we'll use majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
								<li>Step 2: Next, we'll ask the voters to choose between Buster and the winner from Step 1, again using majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
								<li>Step 3: Finally, we'll ask the voters to choose between Michael and the winner from Step 2. Whoever wins this third head-to-head contest will be declared the overall winner.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Consider the method described above.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Under this method, who wins the presidency of the Bluth Company?</li>
								<li>Under this method, what societal preference order is produced?</li>
								<li>In light of the plurality and Borda count results for this election, does anything about your answers to Questions 1 and 2 strike you as being strange or unusual? Explain.</li>
								<li>Is there a Condorcet winner and/or loser in this election? Explain.</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p>
								The method described above is known as <term>sequential pairwise voting</term>. What strikes you as being different or unusual about it, especially compared to the plurality and Borda count systems we've already explored?
							</p>
					
					
						</statement>
					</exploration>
					
					<p>
						We'll finish this section by exploring sequential pairwise voting and the CWC/CLC a bit more.
					</p>
					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
							<ol>
								<li>Could a Condorcet winner ever lose a head-to-head contest with another candidate? Why or why not?</li>
								<li>What does your answer to Question 1 allow you to conclude about sequential pairwise voting and the CWC?</li>
								<li>Does sequential pairwise voting satisfy the CLC? If so, explain why. Otherwise, give an example of a preference schedule for which sequential pairwise voting could elect a Condorcet loser.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</investigation>
					
					<p>
						As we have just seen, SPV satisfies the CWC. This means that it will always elect a Condorcet winner if one exists.
						However, when a Condorcet winner does not exist, as is the case in the Bluth Company presidential election, strange things can happen.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the actual preference schedule, the biggest factor deciding the outcome of SPV is the order in which the candidates face off.
						This order is called the <term>agenda</term>, and is usually specified by listing the candidates in the order into which they are to be introduced to the comparisons.
						In <xref ref="expl-spv" />, the agenda was G, L, B, M.
					</p>
					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
						<p>Consider the familiar preference schedule given in <xref ref="table-bcprez" />.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Who would win the Bluth Company presidency using SPV with the agenda B, G, L, M?</li>
								<li>Find a sequential pairwise voting agenda for which Buster would win the presidency.</li>
								<li>Find a sequential pairwise voting agenda for which George would win the presidency.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</investigation>
					
					<p>
						We thus see that when there is no Condorcet winner, the agenda can play an outsize role in the outcome of an election decided by sequential pairwise voting.
						Since the order in which the candidates are presented seems to matter, it's reasonable to guess that SPV violates the neutrality criterion, which we confirm in the next exploration.

					<p>
									In this section, we'll examine one last (new) voting system, called <term>instant runoff voting</term> (IRV) or <term>ranked choice voting</term> (RCV). <aside>The nonpartisan election advocacy group, FairVote, refers to this system as RCV. I prefer calling the system <em>instant runoff</em>; the non-plurality systems we've looked at for three or more candidates all involve ranking candidates, so I find the term too general.</aside>
									This system was proposed in the mid-1800s by Thomas Hare, and has slowly grown in popularity.
									Other than plurality, it is likely the most widely used system for choosing elected officials in the U.S.
									For example, the <url href="http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/index.htm">City of Minneapolis</url> uses IRV for its city-wide elections, and <url href="http://www.rcvmaine.com">Maine uses it for all state-wide elections</url>, including, for the first time in 2020, for the <url href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maine-ranked-choice-voting-2020_n_5d72ca74e4b06451356df0f3">general election for president</url>.

								<p>
									There is one more important fairness criterion we'll discuss.
									It's more subtle than some of the others, so we'll present a few versions of it.
									In short, what it says is that we want the societal preference between two candidates to depend <em>only on</em> the voters' preferences <em>between those two candidates.</em>
								</p>
					
								<definition>
									<p>
										If a voting system has the property that the societal preference between any two candidates depends only on the voters' preferences between those two candidates, then the system is said to satisfy the <term>independence of irrelevant alternatives</term> criterion (IIA).
									</p>
									<p>
										Put another way, a voting system satisfies IIA if some or all of the voters in an election change their preference ballots but no voter changes their preference between two candidates <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then the societal preference between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must also remain unchanged.
									</p>
								</definition>
								
								<p>
									IAA is often interpreted as saying that if a candidate (<m>A</m>) would win an election, and a new candidate (<m>B</m>) were added to the ballot, then either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> should win the election.
									A further delightful illustration of a violation of IIA is attributed to <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser">Sidney Morgenbesser</url>:
									</p>
					
									<blockquote>
									After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>
										Let's consider our current systems and IIA.
									</p>
									
									<investigation>
										<statement>
											<ol>
												<li>	Does plurality satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
												<li>	Does the Borda count satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>

												<li>	Does IRV satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
											</ol>
										</statement>
									</investigation>
					
					
					
								<p>
									At this point, you may be wondering which voting system is best. We saw a decisive answer if our election has only two candidates (the familiar <em>majority rule</em>), but when the election has more than two candidates, things have gotten complicated. Plurality, majority rule, the Borda count, SPV, and IRV all fail to satisfy at least one of our criteria.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									In 1951, economist <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</url> proved the following landmark result. It states that our quest is hopeless! There is no fairest voting system.
								</p>
								
								
								<assemblage>
						  <title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
							  
							  <p>
								  In an election with more than two candidates, it is impossible for a voting system to satisfy monotonicity, neutrality, anonymity, IIA, the majority criterion, and the CWC. <aside>Technically, we also need to assume that the votes matter (not imposed rule), and that there is no dictator.</aside>
							</p>
					  </assemblage>
					  
						  <principle>
							  <p>
								  There is an ongoing debate about whether voting systems other than plurality are truly <q>democratic</q>.
								  For instance, lawmakers in Maine have repeatedly attempted to overturn the implementation of IRV for statewide elections, despite it passing on a statewide ballot initiative; see the "Timeline of Ranked Choice Voting in Maine" at the bottom of <url href="http://www.rcvmaine.com">this page</url>.
							  </p>
							<p>
								What do you think? Regardless of which system you choose, what do you think of systems that take voter preferences beyond their first choice into account?
								What effect(s) do you think it might have on elections? On campaigning?
								Are there any other advantages or disadvantages you'd like to raise?

					<introduction>
						
						<p>
							Apportionment is the process by which the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided amongst the states. Every ten  years, following a census, Congress must pass a new apportionment bill.  A state's apportionment in Congress is also directly tied to its power in the electoral college, so the electoral votes after the 2024 presidential election will likely look different than it did following the 2020 election.

								<p>
									In 1820, the Census recorded populations of 1,368,775 for New York and 8,969,878 for the entire U.S.

								</ol>
							</statement>
						</exploration>
						
						<p>
							As one can imagine, this caused some consternation at the time.
							Unfortunately (though perhaps unsurprisingly), Congress did nothing. Perhaps they hoped the problem wouldn't happen again.
							But then it did, in the very next apportionment, in 1832.
							Further, it turns out that if Jefferson's method had continued to be used, something similar would have happened in every apportionment since 1852.

							The method used in 1842 was due to Daniel Webster, and modifies Jefferson and Adams only slightly.
							Rather than rounding the quotas always up or always down, Webster proposed that they should be rounded conventionally (i.e., a decimal part less than 0.5 gets rounded down, while a decimal part at least 0.5 gets rounded up)
						</p>
						<p>
							It turns out that Webster's method can also violate quota, though this is much less likely. In fact, if Webster's method had been used in every apportionment from 1794 to 2012, it would not have violated quota once.
							As it happened, though, Webster's method was only used in 1842.
							Perhaps Congress was wary of continuing to use a method that could violate quota after 1822 and 1832.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1850, Samuel Vinton proposed what turned out to be Hamilton's method all over again, though no one remembered it as such<fn>Who tells your story, indeed.</fn>
							It happens that Hamilton's method cannot violate quota (why?).
							It was used for the apportionments of 1852 and 1862, though by 1872, Congress illegally and unconstitutionally apportioned seats based on no method at all.
							This had consequences for the presidential election of 1876, where Hayes defeated Tilden based on the electoral college, whereas if Hamilton's method had been used in 1872, Tilden would have easily won.
						</p>
						<p>
							Congress went back to Hamilton's method in 1882, but not for long.
							In the next section, we'll look at some paradoxes that can arise from the apportionment process.

							We've already seen that apportionment is a trickier subject than it might seem at first.
							However, things are about to get downright weird as we study three apportionment <em>paradoxes</em>, by which we mean surprising or counterintuitive results.
							While these might seem farfetched, we'll see that they arose naturally in the history of apportionment in the U.S. and helped lead to the apportionment process we use today.

							<title>The Alabama Paradox</title>
							
							<p>
								In the course of apportioning the House seats in 1882, the U.S. Census Bureau calculated apportionments using Hamilton's method for all sizes of House between 275 and 350 seats.
								Something strange was afoot for Alabama.
							</p>
							
							<exploration xml:id="expl-alabama-paradox">
								<title>The Apportionment of 1882</title>
								<statement>
									<p>
										With a House size of 299 seats, Alabama's standard quota was 7.646, Illinois' was 18.640, and Texas's was 9.640.
										Ranked from largest to smallest by decimal part, Alabama was 20th on the list.
										With 299 seats, there were 20 surplus seats to dole out.
									</p>
									<p>
										With 300 seats, the standard quotas for all states increased a bit. (Why?)
										Alabama's increased to 7.671, Illinois' to 18.702, and Texas' to 9.672.
										This moved Illinois into the 20th spot in line, with Texas next, and then Alabama.
										With a House of size 300, there were 21 surplus seats to be doled out, rather than 20.
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>How many seats would Hamilton's method give to each of these states with 299 seats?</li>
										<li>How many seats would Hamilton's method give to each of these states with 300 seats?</li>

								</statement>

							<p>
								While it didn't present itself in the first few uses of Hamilton's method, the Alabama paradox can happen fairly regularly, and perhaps validates Washington's veto of Hamilton's method (though it is unlikely that Washington actually observed this phenomenon before deciding to veto Hamilton's method).
								Congress resolved this paradox by choosing a new House size of 325, a size at which the paradox did not occur.
								</p>
								
								<exploration>
									<title>The Apportionment of 1902</title>
									
									
									<statement>
										<p>
											For the 1902 apportionment, the Census Bureau gave Congress a table showing the apportionments under Hamilton's method for all House sizes from 350 to 400.
										</p>	
										<ul>
											<li>When the number of seats in the House was 350-382, 386, 389, and 390, Maine would be given three seats, but for all other sizes Maine would be given four.</li>
											<li>When the number of House seats was 357, Colorado would be given two seats, but for all other House sizes Colorado would be given three seats.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Based only on these data, would the Alabama paradox have occurred for at least one House size between 350 and 400 seats (under Hamilton's method)? If so, for which House sizes and which states?
										</p>
									
									
									</statement>
					
									
									
								</exploration>
								
								<p>
									In the end, this was the end of Hamilton's method in apportioning House sizes.
									Congress used Webster's method on a final House size of 386 seats.
									However, Hamilton's method has been a fruitful source of additional paradoxes and so has remained a subject of study (in addition to its seemingly intuitive way of dealing with decimal parts).

							<title>The New-States Paradox and the Balinski-Young Theorem</title>
							
							<exploration>
								<statement>
									<p>
										In 1907, Oklahoma was the 46th state to join the Union.
										Rather than completely reapportion the seats, Congress decided to give Oklahoma 5 seats, as this was in proportion to its share of the country's population.
										This increased the House size from 386 to 391.
										However, the following hypothetical apportionments were noted under Hamilton's method:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>With 45 states (pre-Oklahoma) and 386 seats, New York would have been awarded 38 seats and Maine 4 seats.</li>
										<li>With 46 seats (including Oklahoma) and 391 seats, New York would have been awarded 37 seats and Maine 5 seats.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Explain why this is yet another paradox (called the <term>new-states paradox</term>).
									</p>
								</statement>
							</exploration>
							
							<p>
								As it turns out, divisor methods (like Jefferson's, Adams', and Webster's) are not susceptible to these paradoxes.
								However, as we saw, they can violate quota.
								This is in contrast to Hamilton's method, which does not violate quota but is susceptible to these paradoxes.
								A reasonable person might wonder if there isn't some better method that both satisfies quota <em>and</em> cannot fall victim to these paradoxes.
								Fascinatingly, the answer is a resounding <em>no</em>.

							<theorem>

										It is impossible for an apportionment method that divides representation among three or more states to satisfy quota and be incapable of producing paradoxes.

							<title>Hill's Method</title>
							
							
							<p>
								The last method we'll consider is the one used today.
								It was originally proposed by Joseph Hill, Chief Statistician of the U.S. Census Bureau, in the early 1900s and was eventually signed into law by FDR following the apportionment of 1942.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								To understand Hill's method, a new perspective on conventional rounding is helpful.
								When we consider rounding a number like 11.494, we usually compare it to 11.5, which is halfway between the whole numbers 11 and 12.
								Another way to think of 11.5, though, is as the <em>mean</em> of 11 and 12: <m>\frac{11+12}{2} = 11.5</m>.
								But this mean is more properly known as the <em>arithmetic mean</em>.
								Another mean exists: the <em>geometric mean</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Given whole numbers <m>m,n</m>, the geometric mean is the number <m>\sqrt{m\cdot n}</m>.
								In our example, <m>\sqrt{11\cdot 12} = 11.4891</m>; this, then, is the number to which we'll compare our standard quotas in Hill's method.
								And thus, a standard quota of 11.494 would be rounded <em>up</em> to 12 rather than down to 11.

											<li>Round each modified quota based on the geometric mean of the two whole numbers between which the modified quota sits. If the sum of the rounded quotas equals the total number of seats being apportioned, we are done. Otherwise, repeat Step 3 with a different modified divisor.</li>
